            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Lordſhips kinde acceptance of this mean Treatiſe in its firſt part, brings the reſt of it now to your feet, upon hope it may goe out with the like countenance and favour. In theſe very miſerable times, when ſo many of all conditions, are given over to beleeve lies, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled with the hypocriſie of ſeducing ſpirits, which the Lord in his juſtice has permitted to goe forth in a great multitude, for the ſeduction of this preſent evill world; the truth is glad of the patrociny and aſſiſtance of all who will be on its ſide; and of none more then of ſuch as your Lordſhip: I mean of perſons ſo much eminent in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, learning, courage, zeal, and other noble qualities, above the moſt of their fellows in birth and rank, as theſe doe ordinarily account themſelves elevated by their civill priviledges, above the common multitude.</p>
            <p>And truly it will be found no leſſe prudence then piety for men of your Lordſhips place, to put and hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in theſe unhappy days, upon the ſide of truth, though never ſo much deſerted, diſgraced, and trampled upon by a world of ſimple or malicious ignorants. For now it is when the Lord with his axe is going through his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and hewing down not onely thouſands of brambles and buſhes of lower ſtature, but many of the talleſt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars, the higheſt Palms, the thickeſt Oaks: and they who yet remain untouched, though none doe know how ſoon the axe may be applyed to their branches, yea their very root, yet many have reaſon to fear that their ſtroak may be ſuddain.</p>
            <p>Among the wofull ſpectacles of our time, none uſe to
<pb facs="tcp:124957:3"/> touch a heart wherein is any humanity, with more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, then the ruine of ancient Families: How many great and potent houſes are blown over by theſe late tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts? How many this day be tottering and very like to fall before the windes be calmed? and of thoſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in leaſt danger, being incompaſſed with the thickeſt defences that policy can invent againſt all ſtorms above ground, how eaſily may ſubterraneous vapours ſhake their foundations? and when all fear is paſt of the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and inviſible ſtorm, by an unexpected Earthquake, lay their wals alſo levell with the ground? There is no ſecurity for the greateſt and ſtrongeſt edifices, but in the rock of truth: what ever is builded upon this, were it never ſo brittle, will ſtand out the greateſt blaſts: And if any breach be made, the God of truth will not fail to repair it, till the appointed time for the change of all things under the Sun, bring that Cottage of clay to its fatall period: And even then, the houſe ſhall fall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice to the Inhabitant, whoſoever hath been a true lover and patron of truth. For how ſmall is the loſſe of a tranſlation from a manſion upon earth, to one in the heaven not made with hands? But here is a loſſe indeed, and a fall truly lamentable, which oft to our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row we may ſee, and have reaſon to fear ſhall yet be more frequent amongſt us, when unhappy Inhabitants by the hands of their errors and vices, ſubvert the pillars of their Anceſtors habitation, and bury with themſelves their whole family, under the rubbiſh of a temporall ruine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hope of reparation either in earth or heaven.</p>
            <p>In the following writ I point at the danger wherein not onely families, but the whole fabrick of our Churches and Kingdomes doe for the preſent ſtand: while the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopall and Sectarian factions are doing their utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to have all our former ſufferings to be but ſhort pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues to new very prolix if not endleſs, Tragedies. The one
<pb facs="tcp:124957:3"/> ſo far demented with a frantick paſſion towards the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſervice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which they have brought upon themſelves and milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others, have not in the leaſt degree cured the diſeaſe of their corrupted mindes, ſo far are they from untying the knots that their own hands have made, or eſſaying to draw any of their deceived party, out of the perplexities of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, wherein their miſ-informations alone have caſt them, that rather then to retract their errors, rather then to adviſe the lawfulneſſe of joyning with all the reſt of the Reformed Churches, in laying aſide Epiſcopacy and Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick ceremonies; they chooſe to give up the neck of their Countrey to the ſword of bloudy and idolatrous ſtrangers; They are content to draw all again to the hazard of a new more terrible war: Tell them of the too probable iſſue of their obſtinacy, that if their deſigns ſhould proſper, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger would be greater, then their wit, or the wiſdome of any mortall creature could ſecure us from, to have a tyranny planted in our State, and Popery without any more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locution, ſetled in our Church. But if their renued warre ſhould again miſcarry, that then the hazard is evident, of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing the royal family, of turning the civil State of <hi>England</hi> into a <hi>Babell</hi> of confuſion, and the Church thereof into a fountain of hereſies, for the intoxication with its ſtreams of all the reſt of the Reformed. To all ſuch very rationall diſcourſes, this generation of men is deaf, as if all naturall affection to their diſtreſſed Countrey were dead, and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy with any of the true Churches of Chriſt, altogether extinguiſhed in them.</p>
            <p>This is one ground of our preſent fear, O if it were all, ſo ſhould we, if needs muſt, goe out again with great courage againſt that Squadron of Malignants: But when we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Victors from that field, behold our more perillous exerciſes are but yet approaching. The Sectaries of more names and kindes then ever were known in any Kingdome
<pb facs="tcp:124957:4"/> of the world, tell us with open mouth, we muſt be their ſlaves: They muſt have liberty to overthrow our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; all Kings, all Lords, and this Houſe of Commons; to ſet up the individuals, as they love to ſpeak, of the whole multitude, in the Throne of abſolute Soveraignty. From this new Soveraign we are commanded to expect a body of new Laws, a modell of a new Ochlocratorick government. This yoak, much worſe then a Turkiſh ſlavery, muſt be put upon our body, but a worſe upon our ſoul: A full liberty muſt be granted to every Seducer, who will in the moſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick places, &amp; within the doors of our houſes alſo, perſwade our loving conſorts, our dear children, our faithfull ſervants &amp; friends, to deny Chriſt, to embrace <hi>Mahomets</hi> Alcoran, the Jewiſh Talmud, the fables of the Pagan Poets, in place of the Old and New Teſtament, for the everlaſting deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſouls. This is the reward which the Sectaries plead for, as due to their labors in the war againſt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Enemy: would they ſtand to the determination of the moſt favorable, if any way equitable Judge, they pleaſed to chuſe, glad would we be to ſee their merits weighed to the full, and much above all their deſervings attributed unto them; But by any poſſible deſerving, to think of obtaining a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to doe a great deal more miſchief both to Church and State, both to the ſouls and bodies of men, then ever any former enemy did intend, carries not the face of any juſtice.</p>
            <p>As for their great deſervings, which always they are trumpeting out with a loud noiſe, we onely ſay that they doe not prudently, to bring them ſo oft near the ballance of triall: for if that, which I have heard from many, both wife and gracious men, be true, their merits will be found to be but of a very common alloy. Where did the moſt of them lurk when the heat of the day did ſcorch the valiant labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of both Nations?

When <hi>Leſlie</hi> about <hi>Bawdoun</hi> was compaſſed for ſome weeks, in the bare fields with froſt and ſnow, with wants of all kinds, with the very gallant Army of <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> double in number, and much better provided, then any thing that P. <hi>Rupert</hi> could bring to <hi>Naisby;</hi> when in <hi>Marſton-Moor, David Leſlie</hi> and <hi>Crawford,</hi> with the flour of the <hi>Scots</hi> and gracious <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſters</hi> Army, were breaking the greateſt and moſt formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable ſtrength, that ever the Enemy commanded in all this War. It is true, when the work was as good as done, by the ſweat &amp; bloud of others, when the Enemies were become ſo low, that they were never more able to bring ten thouſand together, when the danger was well-near all over and gone, then was it good time for them to come in play, and with their cunning legerdemain, to ſhuffle all others, who had managed the Game while it was hazardous. They were then ſo wiſe as in the end of the day, with a great deal of courage, to fall upon the back of a broken Enemy. It could be no great miracle of valour and conduct, to take up the forces and treaſure almoſt of all <hi>England,</hi> and then at <hi>Nais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> with a greater number well payed, armed, and diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to beat nine thouſand of evill led, evill payed, and evill armed ſoldiers, the moſt part raw and new levied <hi>Welſhes.</hi> Had they ever any enemy after that day in the field, of half either their number or ſtrength?

            <p>I have oft been witneſſe with much joy, to the abundant zeal of divers the Lords faithfull Miniſters, both in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly and City, who in their Writings and Sermons, and private ſedulity, have endeavoured to their power the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening of all about them, for the defence of that truth which Chriſt had committed to their truſt; So that I am ſure, that when ever they ſhall come to their accounts, their Maſter will accept and bleſſe their fidelity.

In all our combats againſt error, or whatever evill elſe of the time, we muſt be very attentive that we give not the leaſt diſcouragement to true Piety, for this is ſo ſweet and tender a plant of Gods own hand, that who ever is acquainted with it, will be extreamly loth to doe it the leaſt hurt, were it by their very breath,

The ground of this miſ-aſſertion I take to be a twofold miſ-apprehenſion: <hi>1.</hi> That all pretenders to piety, though they be found really impious hypocrites, yet for their ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ws of Religion ought not to be dealt with according to their viſible hypocriſie. <hi>2.</hi> That thoſe who are truly pious and really the children of God, may not be compaſſed about with many ſinfull infirmities: It ought to offend none, when the mask is pulled off the face of thoſe who ſcorn God and the world, by the fair pretences of that, which their very rough hands, and the helliſh vapours of their mouth doe demonſtrate was never near their heart: When ſuch are hewen by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, when by the ſword of the Word they are ſlain, when the fire and ſalt of God is caſt upon ſuch, why ſhould any gracious ſoul take it ſelf to be touched? Again, when the moſt true Saints are rebuked moſt ſharply for their errours, or other ſins whereby they offend God, they become inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his diſ-ſervice, and of the advancement of Satans Kingdome, ſo much the more, as their known grace makes the readier paſſage for the communication and propagation to others, of their ungracious and ſinfull corruptions; if here a gracious Phyſitian endeavour to cut off from them their cancerous excreſcences, though it be with ſome pain; yet here there is not the leaſt intention of hurt to any of their ſound members.</p>
            <p>I dare ſay in the name of my brethren,<note place="margin">Presbyterians are far from ſuppreſſing the leaſt meaſure of piety.</note> that when ever they are blowing away with the greateſt earneſtneſſe, the noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſmoak that fils the houſe, to the offence of all within; they ſhall be as loth to put out the ſmalleſt ſpark of grace in

I confidently avow, that no Presbyterian has any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion at all with any diſſenter, about any thing which in the leaſt degree toucheth upon piety and grace: for every part of this they take to proceed from the heart of God, and where ever they finde it, they are willing to embrace it, were it in the boſome of their greateſt enemies, as that which they profeſſe is their own greateſt aim to follow and ſtudy to attain. If at any time they are miſcarried to practice againſt this profeſsion, they acknowledge their errour, and duty to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour amendment and ſatisfaction: I wiſh all our controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies were ſo near an end, as this quickly may be: I hope the Saints will not be ſo unreaſonable, as to make the beating of their unſanctified errours, reflect upon any part of their ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, eſpecially when they who deal with them are ſo carefull as they can, when they break their ſhels, to remember what is within, that they ſpoil not their pearl: and for all which may offend in the cask and ſhard, that the jewell and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which God has incloſed be not trod under foot.</p>

If ever order was neceſſary in the Church, it is now more; when every perſon, man or woman, young or old, whoſe phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is up, muſt be at publick preaching; and if in this they would ſquare their words to any good rule, it were the leſſe evill: But the moſt of their doctrines are meer conceits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the truth of God. Vnhappy Independents, who opened at firſt, and keep open to this day the door of the Church for theſe Satyres, and Vultures, theſe Iim, and Ziim, the great Owles and ſhriek Owls, the wild beaſts of the Deſert, and the wild beaſts of the Iſland, the Dragons, and all the dolefull creatures, to come in and defile, to make havock of all that is moſt precious in the Houſe of God.</p>
            <p>But the order I mean here is chiefly in the State, it will not ſatisfie the Maſters of our miſ-order to keep the Church in confuſion: Since the State will take no notice of them, but lets them encreaſe at their pleaſure, and grow up above the ſtrength of any their Aunceſtors, they are making bold to goe viſit the State, and try their ſtrength upon her, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly they may find as great a facility, to ſet up the Trophee of their triumph upon her ruine, as of that of her weake ſiſter the Church. It is the certain, and now oft printed deſign of ſome, to overthrow from the very foundation the whole edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of our Civill government; No King, no Lord, muſt be heard of hereafter; This Houſe of Commons muſt be caſt down, the Imperiall and abſolute Soveraignty muſt be put in
<pb facs="tcp:124957:16"/> the hands of the multitude of the baſeſt people. They are once every year to chooſe for their ſervants, a new Houſe of Commons, which all this time ſhall draw up a new frame of laws, and a new modell of government. Since this is the h mour that now beats higheſt in the veins of that people, we had ſo much the more need with all our ſtrength to fortifie the houſe of the State; for beleeve it, if that by any hand ſhould be undermined, its fall cannot fail to cruſh the moſt, if not all, who are under the roof thereof. So long as the State doth ſtand, there is always ſome hope of ſubſiſtence for every honeſt man, and of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in time a great part, and poſsibly all their juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, were their Petition never ſo oft laid aſide: But if the State be overthrown, then all is deſperate and gone, every particular perſon with all his deſigns how gracious ſoever, is ready to be overwhelmed in the rubbiſh of the Common wealth. It would be remembred that members of the beſt ſtate are but men and not Angels; It's not to be expected but ſinfull infirmities will cleave to the back of the beſt reformed government; the perfect and ſpotleſſe Republick of <hi>Plato,</hi> may well have ſome place in <hi>Vtopia</hi> or in the Region of the Moon, but upon the earth it never yet did dwell, nor in haſte is like to doe. Let prayers to God, let petitions, Proteſtations, Remonſtrances, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to men, be uſed and repeated from time to time, without any fainting or giving over, till all be obtained that is neceſſary for the good of Church and State. But great caution muſt be uſed, that nothing be either done or ſaid, that may labefactate the juſt honour or power of them whom God and the Laws have entruſted with the Soveraignty; what ever toucheth that, cannot but touch the apple of the eye of every good and wiſe man: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:124957:16"/> at this time, when the project of the Devill is declared to lay Monarchy and both the Houſes of Parliament le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell with the ground; and to ſet on the Throne the beaſt with many heads, the multitude, which with difficulty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, could ever yet be ruled, but to this day was never found to have any skill or dexterity at all in the great art of ruling.</p>
            <p>But to break off prefacing,<note place="margin">The ſcope of the Treatiſe.</note> my intention in the ſubſequent writ is, to proceed in my Diſſwaſive, and that with ſo great obſervance of the three mentioned Caveats, as I am able. The men whom I deal with in this part are Anabaptiſts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they bring in with themſelves both Antinomians, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians, Familiſts, and the moſt of all the Heretiques of the time. I deſire no more from them, as a reward of all my labour for their weall, (for the leaſt hurt to any of their perſons I never minded) but in the fear of God, to conſider the beginning, progreſſe, and iſſue of their way, as I ſet it before them in a ſhort view out of their own Authors, or at leaſt from ſuch writs, as in that ſubject are of unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable faith. If I make it appear, that the ſpirit which from the beginning to this day, did reign in their leaders, cannot be that of grace and truth, ought they not in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to make a ſerious review of their way, leſt ſecurely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, the juſtice of God give them over to be miſcarried to ſuch opinions and practiſes which their ſoul for the preſent abhors; but as I demonſtrate, has exceeding oft been the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of Anabaptiſme in many of its followers both of old and late? If this my ſervice be a means to reclaim ſome of them, and to deterre others from the evill of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I have the deſired fruit of my labour. If I miſſe this, yet my teſtimony to the truth in ſo needfull a time, will, I hope, be acceptable to God, and the conſcience of it will
<pb facs="tcp:124957:17"/> eaſe and refreſh my ſpirit, remembring that the houres of my leiſure were not altogether miſ-ſpent, but many of them ſo diligently as I was able, employed for the ſervice of Him to whom I owe all, and the good of his people.</p>

            <p>Concerning the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Albigenſes</hi> knew not Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme.</note> the man that lays the ſclander of Anabaptiſm upon them is <hi>Petrus Cluniacenſis,</hi> but how unjuſtly I offer to be conſidered not only from this generall very true and confeſſed ground, that the Popiſh Writers of that time do charge theſe honeſt and pious men of <hi>Albi</hi> with many both errours
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:124957:18"/> and crimes, whereof all equitable men beleeve them to have been moſt innocent; but alſo from three particular obſervations: Firſt, they are not challenged by <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> as direct and expreſſe denyers of paedobaptiſme, but for their affirming the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of infants beleeving, and of their impoſſible ſalvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, he alledges upon them by way of conſequence, that they did alſo maintain the Baptiſm of infants to be unprofitable and null <hi>(B).</hi> The learned know how much uſes to be ſaid againſt the burdening of men with all the conſequents of their tenets, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the party rejects them, and the things themſelves have no neceſſary dependence. Secondly, the antecedent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this conſequent is builded, we much doubt if ever it came in the thoughts of the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> That theſe gracious and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe men ſhould have been ſo abſurd as to damne abſolutely all infants dying in their infancy, which never any of the groſſeſt Hereticks to this day did affirm; we muſt be pardoned to deny our beleef to ten witneſſes of much better faith then the Abbot of <hi>Cluny.</hi> Thirdly, that which <hi>Caſſander</hi> avows in that ſame place helps to evidence the ſclander of <hi>Cluniacenſis:</hi> the <hi>Valdenſes</hi> were the children and immediate ſucceſſors of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> many of their writs yet extant ſhew how rigid and punctuall obſervers the children were of their Fathers ways: now it is <hi>Caſſanders</hi> remark verified by the writs and known practiſe to this day of all the <hi>Valdenſes</hi> that they have been conſtant paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts <hi>(C).</hi> He muſt therefore be a man of greater authority then any Frier or Monk of theſe dark times, who ſhall be able to perſwade that their Fathers the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> were againſt infants baptiſme.</p>
            <p>Wherfore notwithſtanding of all which is miſalledged from <hi>Caſſander</hi> we may ſafely with all Proteſtant Writers affirm that the firſt known Fathers of Anabaptiſm were <hi>Nicholas Stock</hi> and <hi>Thomas Muncer,</hi> who in the year 1622. began to ſow the tares of that ſect in <hi>Saxony</hi> with too great ſucceſſe.<note place="margin">Neither <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> nor <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roloſtadius</hi> did ever favour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipaedobaptiſm.</note> What ſome alledge of <hi>Melancthon</hi> and <hi>Caroloſtadius</hi> their favour towards theſe men, of <hi>Melancthon</hi> it is moſt falſe as many of his writs declare <hi>(D),</hi> unleſſe it be underſtood of his good and extraordinary meek na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby he was ever inclined to pity the worſt of men ſo long as there was any hope by loving dealing to do them good. <hi>Caroloſtadius</hi> indeed was a raſh hot headed man, and at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:124957:18"/> did give too much countenance to the Anabaptiſts, albeit not in the point of Antipaedobaptiſme <hi>(E),</hi> ſo far as we can find; but wherein ſoever he favoured theſe fanatick men, he did quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent and made his publick retractations to the ſatisfaction of <hi>Luthers</hi> own minde <hi>(F).</hi>

            <p>M. <hi>Tombs</hi> by all his diligence to ſearch for ancient and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned friends to his Clients the Anabaptiſts, does but raiſe duſt to darken the air about himſelfe: all who will be at the pains to conſider theſe very teſtimonies which he alledgeth, ſhall finde that no Divine of good fame did ever joyn with that ſect: for the ſpirit that did reign therein was ſo evidently malignant, that a ſmall meaſure of diſcretion did ever ſerve to diſcover and avoid him.</p>
            <p>When the light of the Goſpel from the Lamp of <hi>Luther</hi> did begin to ſhine in all the corners of <hi>Germany</hi> high and low,<note place="margin">The true origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the Anabaptiſts.</note> the forementioned unhappy men <hi>Stock</hi> and <hi>Muncer,</hi> did begin alſo to breath out a peſtiferous vapour for to overcloud that Golden candleſtick. Satan and Antichriſt his child got no ſo powerfull aſſiſtance againſt the Spirit of God in <hi>Luther</hi> from the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The malignity of their ſpirit.</note> although the far greateſt Prince who theſe five hundred years did ſway the Imperiall Scepter, nor from all the Biſhops of <hi>Germany,</hi> though the moſt potent Clergy that is or ever hath been in Chriſtendome, as from theſe two obſcure and ignorant creatures: for ſo ſtrong and perverſe a Devil did enter into them, as did put them into a very fair way not only to have extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the candle of Reformation ſo ſoon as ever it began to ſhine, but alſo to have turned the remainder of light that was in all Chriſtendome into palpable darkneſſe <hi>(G).</hi> The ſpirit of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met was no more helliſh in ſetting afoot moſt groſſe errors, and countenancing abominable luſts; nor was it any thing ſo much helliſh in making an open trade of bloodſhed, robbery, confuſion and Catholick oppreſſion through the whole earth, as the ſpirit of Anabaptiſme. This great and ſevere ſentence will be made good enough in the following Narrative by ſuch abundance of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Teſtimonies, as may convince the greateſt favourers of theſe men among us.</p>
            <p>At the beginning the Anabaptiſts put on the viſorn of a great deal more then ordinary piety, zeal, and honeſty:<note place="margin">Their ſingular hypocriſie.</note> in prayer and meditation they were very frequent and long, their diſcourſes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:124957:19"/> were only of matters Divine, the errours and ſuperſtitions of the time were to them abominations; for life and converſation, they ſeemed to be compoſed of all vertue; in their apparell poor and baſe; in their behaviour and ſpeech exceeding humble and grave; for charity towards all in want, ſingularly liberall <hi>(H).</hi> The er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours they had, ſeemed to be very harmleſſe and innocent; they urged not only a reformation of corruptions, but the building of a Church wholly new; they preſſed that what ever had been in Popery might all be caſt away; that new Churches might be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered conſiſting only of Saints. Beſides the Scripture they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed new revelations; they required all their followers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their former Baptiſm, and of new to be baptized; they ſpoke much of patient ſuffering the Croſſe, of the unlawfulneſſe to reſiſt injuries, or to puniſh by the ſword any crime; they cried down all Wars, yea all Magiſtracy, all Judicatories as unjuſt; they preached much for the Liberty of the People, and againſt the grievous burdens wherewith the great ones did load the backs of the poor Commons; they cried up an equality among all the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> that none might Lord it over his Brethren; alſo that all goods ought to be common among Chriſtians, that none might want, and none be tempted with ſuperfluity.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous pity and charity of good men towards them was the cauſe of their ſtrength.</note>So long as they keeped themſelves within theſe bounds, ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe Preachers were content to deal with them lovingly by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and diſputations, to keep the ſword of the Magiſtrate off them <hi>(l),</hi> and none was a more diligent ſolicitor of their indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity then <hi>Luther</hi> with all the Princes of his acquaintance <hi>(K).</hi> But behold the fruits of this indulgence, <hi>Stock</hi> and <hi>Muncer</hi> are encouraged thereby to go on, in the ſpace of three years they did diſperſe their cockle and tares over all <hi>Germany,</hi> the people eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where fell in paſſionate love with their Doctrine <hi>(L):</hi> the Maſters beholding the unexpected number and zeal of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, without further delay did bring out all their myſteries, and what before they had delivered in corners, and in the night time to handfuls of people apart, being then confident of their ſtrength, they brought it out to the world before the Sun, and boldly did begin to put all their ſpeculations in practiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Their wicked Doctrines and practiſes.</note>They declared that they were Prophets ſent by God to teach the world the way to heaven, that after faſting and prayer they were inſpired with revelations no leſſe ſure then Scripture, which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:124957:19"/> all were to beleeve and follow under the pain of damnation: that <hi>Luther</hi> and all the orthodox Preachers were falſe Prophets, worſe then the Pope and his Clergy; that all Princes and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates muſt needs lay down their Charges, and become equall with the meaneſt; that all rich perſons behoved to give in their wealth, that all goods might be equally diſtributed; that the time of the Saints raign upon earth was come; that whoſoever refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to enter into their ſociety, to be rebaptized and to become members of their Churches, were without all pity to be killed.

Being rejected of <hi>Luther</hi> and his Diſciples, he went to try <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and his friends: unawares, and upon a ſudden great numbers of Anabaptiſts did ariſe in <hi>Zurick, Berne, Baſil,</hi> and many other parts of <hi>Suitzerland:</hi> at the beginning they diſſembled the worſt of their tenets, they dealt earneſtly with <hi>Zuinglius</hi> to gather out of the Churches he had reformed new ſeparate Congregations: many remonſtrances did they make unto him againſt the prophanity of the common multitude, and for the holineſſe that ought to be in every Church member; they alledged a neceſſity for the Saints to put themſelves in new diſtinct Churches <hi>(S).</hi> The ſame things did they preſſe upon <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampadius</hi> at <hi>Baſil,</hi> but when theſe grave men had rejected their motion, and demonſtrated the iniquity of their Schiſmatick way: then without more ado having ſeduced multitudes by their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and night Sermons, they did themſelves erect without any permiſſion either of the Magiſtrates or Miniſters, their ſeparate Congregations <hi>(T),</hi> and for a viſible diſtinguiſhing Character of their way they publickly anabaptized all who did enter into their Society <hi>(V).</hi> For theſe inſolencies the Magiſtrate was offended and put ſome of them in Priſon, preſently they cried out loud of perſecution for conſcience <hi>(X),</hi> and of unjuſt condemnation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their cauſe was tried: hereupon many publick diſputations were inſtitute, <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and others in <hi>Zurick</hi> many days from morning till evening did debate with them in preſence of the Magiſtrate and all who pleaſed at great length upon all their Tenets; this ſame did <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> in <hi>Baſil,</hi> and others in <hi>Bern,</hi> the arguments and anſwers with the conſent of both ſides were written and publiſhed, by this means many received ſatisfaction, many alſo remained obſtinate in their errour and became tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous in their practiſes, which cauſed the moſt of them to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out of theſe States.<note place="margin">The reaſon of their baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thence.</note> Unto this ſeverity the Magiſtrate was forced by the danger of their principles, and their uſuall wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king accordingly, where fear kept them not in order: in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

            </p>

            </head>
            <p>THE errours of the Anabaptiſts and their diviſions amongſt themſelves are ſo many,<note place="margin">The moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded Tenets of our modern Anabaptiſts, are the ſelf-ſame with what the old Anabaptiſts did invent.</note> that to ſet them down diſtinctly in any good order, is a task which I dare not undertake: much leſſe can I give aſſurance what is common to them all and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to their ſeverall ſects: only that I may demonſtrate the ſame very ſpirit to breath this day in the Anabaptiſts of <hi>Britain,</hi> which inſpired their Fathers of former times in <hi>Germany,</hi> I will remark what tenets Authors of good credit aſcribe to both; hoping that this diſcovery may be a means to bring many ſimple wel-meaning people who are not yet plunged in the deeps of obſtinacy to a more accurate triall and greater ſuſpicion of their ways: when they ſhall ſee it made viſible and palpable upon undeniable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that their moſt beloved tenets and practiſes which they beleeve to be full of truth and holineſſe, are no other but the ſame very ſingularities which the known event doth now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince all who without prejudice can but read unqueſtionable Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, to have been the inventions and dictates of the falſe and unclean ſpirit which acted and moved in <hi>Muncer, Becold, David George,</hi> and ſuch like abominable monſters of mankind.<note place="margin">Their firſt and prime Tenet was a neceſſity of gathering Churches out of Churches, and of ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the beſt reformed in their time, becauſe of mixt communion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt and leading tenet of the old Anabaptiſts was a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to gather new Churches out of theſe which <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius</hi> and their followers had reformed from Popery <hi>(A).</hi> It is remarkable that theſe men had never a ſtomach to trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with any labour to make converts from Popery or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe, only ſo ſoon as gracious perſons had drawn any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Countries out of the kingdom of Antichriſt, then they fell on and every where did much diſturb the work of the new Reformation <hi>(B).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the beginning they diſſembled the groſſeſt of their errours, and their intention to quarrell infants baptiſm: they did only preſſe a greater meaſure of holineſſe and mortification then was ordinary <hi>(C),</hi> in this all good men went along with them: but when they began to teach that the Church behoved to conſiſt of no other members but ſuch as were not in profeſſion and aim
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:124957:32"/> alone, but alſo viſibly and really holy and elect, and therefore that new Churches behoved to be gathered, and that all the old any where extant behoved to be ſeparate from as mixed, and ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſocieties; then <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> did oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this ſchiſmatick humour <hi>(D).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they found themſelves diſappointed of the aſſiſtance of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> and all the reſt of the orthodox Preachers, without more delay they fell upon their intended work them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone, firſt by private conventicles <hi>(E),</hi> then by preaching in the open ſtreets they gathered and ſet up Churches after their own mind <hi>(F),</hi> conſiſting meerly of Saints <hi>(G),</hi> who did forbear communion in religious exerciſes with all other Churches <hi>(H),</hi> whom they avowed to be for the moſt part but worldly, carnall, and prophane Goſpellers <hi>(I),</hi> and their beſt Preachers, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> to be but Scribes and Phariſees, falſe Prophets, large as evill as the Pope and his Antichriſtian Prieſts <hi>(K).</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>(C) Bullinger lib. 1. p. 11.</hi> In their ſeparate Congregations they did cry mightily againſt pride, againſt gluttony and drunkenneſſe, blaſphemy and other crimes: they led a life in appearance ſpirituall, they ſighed oft and did not laugh; in reproofs they were vehement, they ſpoke excellently; by this means they purchaſed admiration and authority to themſelves among ſimple and pious people who did ſpeak thus. Let other men ſay of the Anabaptiſts what they pleaſe, I do ſee nothing in them but gravity, I do hear nothing but that we ſhould not ſwear nor do wrong to any, but live piouſly and ſoberly: ſo I ſee no evill in them. <hi>Ibid. p. 52.</hi> The moſt part of the Anabaptiſts and at the beginning theſe of <hi>Munſter</hi> themſelves were lowly and humble, farre from all greatneſſe and ſplendour: for they did inveigh againſt all pride and magnificence, alſo againſt the power and ſword of the Magiſtrate, riches and honour were to them droſſe and dung; they did ſpeak nothing but of mortification of the old man, and renewing of the ſpirit, of a life ſeparate and dedicated to God, the world and all things therein they did altogether contemne.</p>

                  <hi>(I) Bullinger p. 18.</hi> They eſteem themſelves the only true Church which is accepted by Chriſt, they teach that whoever by Anabaptiſm is received into their Church muſt have no communion with any Proteſtant Church or with any other Chriſtians whoſoever: becauſe the Proteſtant Churches are no more true Churches then the Popiſh, which they prove thus. In their Churches there is evident &amp; clear amendment of life, but in theſe Churches that are called Proteſtant, though ſomthing be preached out of the Goſpel, yet no mans life is amended, and the whole people remain impenitent and ſubject to ſinnes and vices, now it is not lawful to have any communion with ſo impure a people.</p>

                  <hi>(N) Bullinger p. 109.</hi> We are compelled ſay they to ſtand beſide and hold our peace whether the Preacher ſpeak right or wrong, thus the Doctrine depends not from Chriſt and his Spirit; if any man come into a Proteſtant Church and hear but one ſpeak this is ſo far contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, that ſuch a company may not be taken for a true and ſpirituall Church.</p>

                  <hi>(Q) Bullinger p. 87.</hi> The Anabaptiſts in defence of their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration alledge againſt the perſons of the Miniſters, that they are not lawfully called, the calling of their own Miniſters they count lawfull, becauſe they are called and ſent by their own Churches, but our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters calling they count unlawfull becauſe by the Magiſtrate, ſo they ſay that themſelves are ſent of God, but that we are ſent by men, that is, by the world.</p>

                  <hi>(X) Bullinger p. 39.</hi> Since the Magiſtrate has decreed that the tythes and yearly rents are juſtly due, ſuch debts by Divine right ought to be payed ſincerely &amp; honeſtly: ſome of the Anabaptiſts convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by clear teſtimonies of Scripture grant that every one who is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged ought to pay tythes, yearly rent, and other debts.</p>

                  <hi>(AA) Clopenburg p. 341.</hi> They do beleeve that Eccleſiaſtick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction is in the body of the whole Church, they do exagitate and ſcorn the practice of our Churches as Judaicall, and they will have gone to be excluded from the Church in judging, but only the ſinner that is to be judged.

               <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The modern Tenets of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHAT is ſet down in the former Chapters of the old Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts over Sea,<note place="margin">The ſpirit of Anabaptiſme clearly devilliſh</note> was in relation to their preſent off-ſpring in <hi>England:</hi> with them chiefly it is that I intend to deal, deſiring if poſſible to draw ſome of them from their evill way, or at leaſt to hold off others who yet are free, from running too raſhly into their errour, before they have a little conſidered it. I hope I have made it ſo clear that no ingenuous knowing reader will hereafter call it in queſtion, that the ſpirit which was the author of Anabaptiſme in <hi>Germany,</hi> and carried on all its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall leaders along their whole courſe, could be no better Angel then Satan, who under the colour of a more then ordinary zeal to the ſmalleſt truths, and of a vehement affection to the higheſt degrees of all holineſſe, was palpably found to set on foot the moſt groſſe and damnable Errours, the moſt abominable obſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, cruelties, robberies, that ever the Sun from its firſt creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this day did ſhine upon in any part of the earth.</p>
            <p>How much of his nature that ſpirit has laid down ſince his late appearance in <hi>England,</hi> it cannot yet with confidence be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced: He was an Angel of light in <hi>Germany</hi> for a longer time then yet he has dwelt among us in any conſiderable viſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for till of late he did but lurk it this Land in the habit of an <hi>Incognito.</hi> Since the time he began to appear in publick there is nothing which he would more gladly diſclaim then theſe crimes, and that face wherewith he did walk over Sea, when he took the boldneſſe to lay aſide his mask, and to ſhew his true viſage as it was without any diſguiſe.</p>
            <p>Tell the Engliſh Anabaptiſts now of the Doctrine and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their fathers in <hi>Munſter</hi> and elſwhere,<note place="margin">The fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of many Engliſh Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts not to be truſted.</note> they are ready with paſſion to deny all affinity all conſanguinity with ſuch monſtrous Hereticks: They will be nothing leſſe then Anabaptiſts, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt they will profeſſe to maintain is but a ſimple Antipaedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. How ever this will be found a very groſſe and dangerous errour, yet we wiſh that all our queſtions with that generation of men were come to ſo narrow an iſſue; we are loth to force upon
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:124957:43"/> any man the errours which he is willing to diſallow; the fewer the differences be, a full agreeance is the more eaſie and near, the multiplication of controverſies makes peace the more difficult and deſperate: yet for many reaſons I conceive it very conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, in all ſolid debates to have before the eye all the reall and materiall points in controverſie, without the concealment of any.</p>
            <p>I did ever eſteem the right underſtanding of the parties true and full ſenſe worth the half of the whole diſpute. I hope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will not be evill taken that I lay together what I finde lately printed here by them who carry the name of Anabaptiſts, or what by grave and religious Divines is in print laid upon them, and is not as yet by any rationall anſwer ſo farre as I know taken off.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">What errors may be charged upon all, what only upon ſome of them.</note>It is true, it fares with them as with divers of their name over Sea, all of them are not of one minde, the opinions of ſome may not be charged upon all: yet it ſeems but juſtice to impute to them all ſuch Tenets of their fellows as they are not pleaſed to refuſe, when they are told over and over publickly in print, that ſuch is the Doctrine of ſome prime members of their Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and after thoſe publick admonitions they are neither pleaſed to call the men to an account, nor to declare againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. What other conſtruction can the world make of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence and ſilence, but that either they joyn all in the challenged errours, or elſe that they count them of ſo ſmall an importance that no man needs to contradict them, but that ſafely they may be entertained by any of their Church who are pleaſed to embrace them? Such indeed has been the ingenuity of the <hi>Tranſmarin</hi> Anabaptiſts to this day, that what ever they conceived to be wrong in any of their Brethren, they were ever as ready to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim and contradict it, as if it had come from their greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. It were much to be wiſhed that ſuch honeſt ſimplicity were ſo familiar to their brethren among us this day.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſeven Churches, is a very imperfect ambiguous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of their judgment</note>How ever the tenets which the moſt of them are likely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, be theſe which ſeven of their beſt Churches did offer in print to the Parliament, as their common ſenſe: We wiſh that all theſe who go under the name of Anabaptiſts in <hi>England,</hi> were reſolved to ſtand to the articles of that confeſſion without any further progreſſe in errour: but how farre the very prime Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are from any ſuch reſolution, it will appear anon. As for the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:124957:43"/> 
               <hi>Members</hi> whether of theſe ſeven, or of their other thirty nine Congregations (for before the penning of that Confeſſion, this ſect was ſaid to be grown unto no leſſe then forty ſixe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>(A),</hi> and that as I take it within and about <hi>London</hi>) the moſt of them are exceeding farre from making theſe Articles the rule of their belief; if we truſt M. <hi>Marſhall (B),</hi> and M. <hi>Black (C),</hi> two very faithfull Divines who have had more dealing with the Anabaptiſts then any other on this ſide the Sea.<note place="margin">Let no error be charged upon any man, which he truly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims.</note>
            </p>
            <p>They are a people very zealous of Liberty, and moſt unwilling to be under the bondage of the judgement of any other: This ſelfiſh ſingularity makes them much to differ, not only from others, but among themſelves alſo: It is hard therefore to faſten any tenets upon them more then they pleaſe to accept; But in this, my dealing with them ſhall be fair, what I aſcribe to them I ſhall bring along my authority for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; if I know the unwillingneſſe of any of them to concurre with my Author, I ſhall be loth to diſſemble it, and if through unacquaintance with the minde of the moſt I ſhall happen to make the particular Tenets of ſome to be generall to all, whenſoever any of them ſhall declare againſt the Tenet of their fellows, for my part I ſhall wiſh all ſuch true and ingenuous declarations whether from few or more, to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with thankfulneſſe: for I profeſſe my gladneſſe to ſee any who are ſuppoſed erroneous to clear themſelves, were it but in ſome part from any of the faults which uſually are charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
            <p>For a more diſtinct proceeding we do referre their Tenets to three heads; firſt, rigid Browniſm; ſecondly, Antipaedobaptiſm;<note place="margin">A brief ſumme of all the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts errors.</note> thirdly, Arminianiſm, Antinomianiſm, Arianiſm, Familiſm, and other groſſe hereſies towards which too many of them are now declined.</p>
            <p>For the firſt,<note place="margin">Every Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt is at leaſt a rigid Separatiſt.</note> the ſobereſt Anabaptiſts do embrace the whole way of the rigid ſeparation. The Browniſh did borrow all their Tenets from the Anabaptiſts of old, it is but equall that the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts this day ſhould ſeek back again their Fathers debt from the Browniſts. The chief ſingularities of Browniſm are about the conſtitution and government of the Church, they ſay the Church is made up only of members who are really and convincingly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of ſuch who do evidence the truth of their regeneration to the ſatisfaction of the whole or the greater part of the Church.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:124957:44"/> Hereupon do they ground their ſeparation from all the reſt of the reformed. It is true, they did ſeparate from the Church of <hi>England</hi> upon another ground alſo, complaining not only of her mixing a prophane multitude with the gracious profeſſors, but alſo for her entertaining a great many Popiſh reliques in diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and worſhip, for theſe like ways did they un-church her and pronounce her an Antichriſtian Synagogue <hi>(D).</hi> But their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from other reformed Churches was grounded on the firſt conſideration only: for they did not cry down the truth of other Churches, as of the Engliſh; yea when a fit of benignity came upon them they did not ſtick to give to the Engliſh it ſelf, the honour of a true Church <hi>(E);</hi> but from the Engliſh and all other of the world they did ſeparate for the impurity and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their members.<note place="margin">Though the Independents offer to collude with the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, yet they ſeparate from the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents no leſſe then from the Browniſts as Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe pleas the Independents hold faſt with both their hands, and upon it are as rigid. Separatiſts as any we know <hi>(F):</hi> but the Anabaptiſts take poſſeſſion of both the grounds, that the walls of their ſeparation may the more firmly be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. They will have all their members to be reall Saints, and they ſeparate from all other Churches who neglect to preſſe the neceſſity of ſuch a qualification <hi>(G),</hi> but to ſtrengthen the right of their ſeparation, they go on to pronounce all theſe Churches from whom they ſeparate Antichriſtian; and this their charity they extend to their otherways very dear friends the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Browniſts, for all even of them are ſuch who by their doctrine and practiſe of paedobaptiſme, deny that Chriſt is yet come in the fleſh <hi>(H).</hi> The Browniſts in their honeſt ſimplicity are loth to be long in the Anabaptiſts debt, they quickly un-Church and excommunicate them alſo for denying baptiſm to infants <hi>(I);</hi> but the Independents will be wiſer then their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Anabaptiſm no there is ſo ſmall a pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>M. <hi>Brown</hi> did take from the Magiſtrate all power about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, theſe he did remit abſolutely to the conſcience of every particular perſon, declaring himſelf while he ſtood in his infamous way for a full liberty of conſcience uncontrollable by the Laws of any mortall man <hi>(YY):</hi> but in this all the diſciples till of late did leave the Maſter.

            <p>In ſuch caſes of extraordinary difficulty, the wiſe people of <hi>Rome</hi> did oftentimes name a Dictator, in whoſe hand for a certain time they placed all their power: the Senate, the Armies, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates both of the City &amp; Provinces, the whole Common-wealth was abſolutely at his diſpoſition: only for his own aſſiſtance in the diſcharge of ſo incomparable a truſt, he did name for a helper and a ſecond, almoſt an equall, a Maſter of Horſe.</p>
            <p>If we ſhould come to this excellent expedient it were not hard for the people of the Sectarian party to fall without much deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, upon a Dictator; to whoſe valour and untainted fidelity they might without fear or the leaſt ſuſpicion commit the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſafety: and if merit may be regarded, if boldneſſe and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in pulling down old Tyrants, whether Kings or Lords or Commons, for the advancement of the people to their due place may be valued, a Lievtenant, a Maſter of Horſe without difficulty might preſently be found.</p>
            <p>This much of their mind already they have declared, that all good people of their own accord without any authority may ariſe in Arms as one man, and when they are up, they may chooſe for their Governor whom they pleaſe <hi>(LLLLL),</hi> and mould the State in what faſhion they conceive to be moſt for their own good <hi>(MMMMM),</hi> and thereafter put the Militia during their pleaſure in the hands of theſe to whom they dare truſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſafety, providing they be known to be firm for abſolute li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of conſcience <hi>(NNNNN):</hi> And among theſe he who runs may reade in their Books one glorious name, in whoſe boſome
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:124957:51"/> the Dictatorian patent could not but fall: only here is the hazard; when <hi>Caeſar</hi> was once poſſeſſed of the Dictators place, he had the skill and the will alſo to keep in his own hand that higheſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for ever. And although the perpetuall Dictatorſhip was a little interrupted by his violent death in the midſt of the Senate, yet never did the command return any more to the people, but in place of their expected liberty their government was changed into a moſt Tyrannick Empire.</p>
            <p>As in nature, ſo in State there is a conſtant viciſſitude, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of one is the generation of another, and that which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth doth poſt to its fall and corruption, that a new plant may come in its ſtead. The raſh and heady overturners of States pull down the poſſeſſors that themſelves may ſit in their rooms, but they are not well hot in their new places, till the judgement of God and the unavoidable circulation which is and ever has been in all ſublunary affairs, caſts them likewiſe out that their ſeats may be void to their preſſing ſucceſſors.</p>

This apprehenſion as yet ſeems to me not altogether groundleſſe, for if this principle be driven on but a little further, if the unwiſe and unjuſt multitude be flattered into a Supremacy of power, and perſwaded of a neceſſity, were it but of a conveniency, or of a meer lawfulneſſe to put down Kings, Lords, and Commons, and to ſet up what ever other Government they think meeteſt for their own ſafety and welfare, I am in the opinion that ſome very mean born Gentlemen (if they have but the skill and conſtancy for ſome little time to play the Cards right that now are in their hands) are in as fair a poſſibility to attain the Dictatorſhip of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was to attain that of <hi>Rome</hi> ſome few years before the civill Warre.

            <p>It is true,<note place="margin">The ſecond E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their Confeſſion is not ſo free of Arminianiſme as the firſt.</note> the late Confeſſion of the ſeven Churches ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject clearly enough all the five Articles of the Arminians; but as our former witneſſes teſtifie, thouſands of them care not for that Confeſſion; yea, I profeſſe I cannot conjecture at the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the ſecond Edition of this Confeſſion which alone was offered to the Parliament, does change ſo many materiall paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the firſt, which point-blank did militate againſt Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſme, unleſſe it be their farther declination to Arminianiſm at the penning of their ſecond Edition.</p>
            <p>For inſtance, the ſeventeenth Article in the firſt Edition ſtood thus, <hi>He hath fully performed all theſe things by which God might reconcile his elect only;</hi> In the ſecond the word only is put away; as if Chriſt by his ſacrifice had reconciled to God all mankinde as well as the elect. This our ſuſpicion is increaſed by finding the ſame alteration acted over again in the Article twenty firſt, where the firſt Edition reads it thus, <hi>Chriſt by his death did bring forth ſalvation and reconciliation only for the elect;</hi> in the ſecond Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the words <hi>reconciliation only</hi> are omitted.

            <p>Likewiſe in that ſame Article I finde two more alterations; In the firſt among the fruits which the elect have of Chriſts Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood are ſet down their juſtification, adoption, regeneration, and ſanctification; all thoſe are omitted in the latter Edition. In the firſt Edition it is ſaid of the Spirit that he is never taken away when once given, but doth ſtill abide begetting and nouriſhing faith unto immortality; this is omitted in the latter Edition. I
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:124957:69"/> grant it is put in the 23 Article, which is clear enough againſt the Arminian errour of perſeverance, had not the addition of one little word caſt it all looſe: for in the former Edition the 23 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle did run thus, <hi>Thoſe that have this precious faith can never to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally nor finally fall away;</hi> but in the latter, <hi>all,</hi> is added, <hi>all theſe cannot fall away, &amp;c.</hi> which is very true, if ſome few perſevere, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit many and the moſt part of theſe who have juſtifying faith ſhould fall away totally and finally.</p>
            <p>If the ground of theſe and many more alterations in the ſecond Edition of that Confeſſion, proceed from any farther inclination to Arminianiſm in any of the prime Leaders of theſe ſeven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, at the time of the ſecond ſubſcription more then appeared at the firſt, I cannot affirm, only M. <hi>Spilsberry,</hi> the chief penner as it ſeems of that writ, does now finde the Arminian errours ſo troubleſome among his friends, that he is forced to publiſh a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Treatiſe againſt them <hi>(VV).</hi>

            <p>I ſpeak not of temporall puniſhments, if the Magiſtrate will employ none of his power for the honor of that God who has ſet him in his place, and preſerves him therein, nor for the relieving of the periſhing ſouls of the people over which he rules; let him prepare to anſwer for it as he may, for it will be the principall <hi>Item</hi> of his great account: onely let him be content to want the compaſſion of all beholders, when God little to his honour ſhall vindicate his own glory, and when Divine Juſtice lets the ſeduced multitude fully looſe to pull out of his hand all power no leſſe about civill, then ſpirituall objects, which eaſily might have kept the people in order and obedience both to God and him, if it had been in any ſeaſon, or even yet were in any wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or courage imployed towards them.</p>
            <p>But that which I moſt regrate is, to ſee ſundry unto whom God has committed the keeping of his truth, and whom he has indued with very notable parts above many, ſo ſparing and coldriffe, ſo ſober and temperate, ſo calme and wiſe in managing the Battels of their Maſter againſt the Enemies of his dearly beloved truth, as if all their zeale were no more mixed, but totally overmaſtered, and well-near drowned in their modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and prudence.</p>
            <p>It is the opinion of many, that the enemies of the truth have been aſſiſted in their evill work of ſeducing millions of the Sheep

Hobſon</hi> has printed that Chriſt did not by his death purchaſe life and ſalvation for all, no not for the elect, for it was not the end of God, in the comming of Chriſt, to purchaſe love and life, but Chriſt himſelf was purchaſed by love that he might make out love, and purchaſe us to love, for Chriſt came not to reconcile God to man, but man to God.</p>

Secondly, if the Spirit of God be God (as he is) equall with the Father and the Son, all three infinite without beginning, each having the whole Divine eſſence, and yet there is but one eſſence, how can the Spirit proceed from the Father originally any more then the Father from the Spirit? and how can the Spirit of God have any more dependence upon the Father and the Son then they have upon him, ſeeing whatſoever is infinite can have no dependence upon any thing? Therefore the Doctors words contain in them the nature of blaſphemy; and to define how one can be three, and three but one, and always ſo remain, is above the reach of any man, I may ſay to him as <hi>Mat. 7.3.

Its favour towards the ſalvation of man appears in its great zeal to caſt out of the Church, and deprive of the means of grace almoſt all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde with the exception of a very few, if of any at all. When the moſt reformed of the Proteſtant Churches come before the fan of their cenſure, at the firſt ſhake they blow away that largeſt and moſt innocent part of them, their infants: all children who have not attained to the acts of faith and repentance, are to them in the fleſh, under the power &amp; within the verge of the Kingdom of Satan, as well as Jews, Turks, Pagans, and others who are not ſo much as entred within the hedge of Chriſts ſheepfold: and leſt the ſpoiling of children of all the grace and gifts of God had not been a ſufficient vaſtation, they are carried on by the ſpirit that leads them, to make as great havock and deſolation among thoſe of riper years: they Unchurch the moſt of thoſe whom otherwiſe they love as their beſt friends; they charge all the Independents, and the Browniſts, and the moſt rigid of the Separatiſts for their baptizing of infants with no lighter a burthen then Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, and a clear deniall of Chriſts Incarnation: Neither here does their raſhneſſe ſtand, the ſmall remnant of Chriſtians, the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtick Societies, which alone they will honour with the title of true Churches, ſeem to them too many to be ſaved; therefore new ſeparations are run into, and thoſe ſo ſevere, that there lives not an Anabaptiſt upon earth, who by multitudes even of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, is not condemned with all who adhere to his ſubdiviſion, as a man in a falſe way not only without, but in oppoſition to the true Church.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">In its di hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of God be ſetting up a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, firſt for all errours.</note>This their extream cruelty againſt the ſouls of men wont to be coloured with the ſhew of zeal to the truth and honour of God, but this varniſh is now almoſt quite wiped off: Behold, whither their zeal to the truth and honour of God is now evaniſhed! They for ſome times were ſo eminently zealous againſt errors and vices, that very ſmall ones were wont to draw from them an eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction out of the Church, a deliverance to Satan, and where the Civill Sword was in their hand, a putting out of this life, a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick execution by the hand of the Hangman, when their Princes and Prophets were not at leiſure to adminiſter Juſtice in their own perſons. Notwithſtanding the loudeſt note that this day ſounds in their ſong, is liberty and freedom from all puniſhments for what ever crimes; when all abominations imaginable are publickly proclaimed, when many more and much viler errours walk in our ſtreets then ever any one place in any time did hear of, the great zeal of theſe religious men breaks out daily, in all the diſcourſes they pleaſe, and actions they dare for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of the curſed inſtruments of theſe errours; paſſionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying all power in any on earth to reſtrain, in the leaſt meaſure, the open propagation of the moſt abominable lies, which Satan is able to utter by the tongue of any creature; no matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſay they can fall under the cogniſance of any State, the falſe Church has no right to cenſures or any Church Ordinance, the trueſt Churches can meddle but with their own members; they who never were of them, or have renounced memberſhip with them, are without their Juriſdiction: ſo neither State nor Church can put any barre of the ſmalleſt cenſure upon the propagation of any errour.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">And next for all vice.</note>And leſt vice, the neer kinſman of errour, ſhould finde any har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der meaſure, any greater ſtop from the hand of ſuperiour powers; this Sect with all the ſpeed it can, is poſting back to its firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the overthrow of the civill State as much as of the Church: That when ever they are found in the practiſe of their Doctrine, of the lawfulneſſe of adultery, and inceſt, robbery, and murder, there may be none upon earth to controll them. For this end they caſt down the King and Parliament, Commons as well as Lords, all Incorporations, all Judicatories in Burgh and Land; that an abſolute Monarchy, a full liberty for every man to do all his pleaſure, without any fear of puniſhment, may be ſet up; That
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:124957:87"/> the Crown and Scepter, the Kingſhip and abſolute Soveraignty may at laſt be reſtored to the onely true owners, the free-born people of <hi>England,</hi> the individuals, as they love to ſpeak, of the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>All this &amp; much more have they ſet under their own hands as may be ſeen in the former Chapters.<note place="margin">Their Browni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick and Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Tenets I have refuted in other Treatiſes</note> I have neither time nor minde to diſpute all their poſitions; in my little Antidote againſt Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm I have in a ſhort and popular way impugned it; their Tenets againſt the Proteſtant Churches in the heads of election, redemption, grace, free-will, and perſeverance; In the firſt Part of my Diſſwaſive, I have debated at length enough the chief of thoſe errours which they have taught their children the Separatiſts: The reall holineſſe of all Church members, the neceſſity of ſeparation for want of ſatisfaction in this point alone, the power of every member of the Church to preach the word, to ordain and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate when there is cauſe their very Paſtors and Elders, the Independency of every Congregation from Presbyteries and Synods, the thouſand years of Chriſts viſible raign upon earth; All this new light did ſhine firſt, and ſtill burns moſt brightly among the Anabaptiſts.</p>
            <p>Although many of the Tenets mentioned in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be diſſembled and denied by divers of this Sect,<note place="margin">Their Antipae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſme and dipping ſhall here bee briefly and plainly conſidered.</note> yet all of them will acknowledge as their own, what ever almoſt is practiſed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Independents or Browniſts; and beſides, two Tenets more, Antipaedobaptiſm, and Dipping: all who carry the name of Anabaptiſme, though through ignorance they know not, or through better inſtruction they diſſent from many poſitions of their Brethren, yet will avowedly and oft with paſſion profeſſe their minde againſt the ſprinkling of infants: paedorantiſme to all of them I ever heard of, is an abomination.</p>
            <p>It will not therefore be amiſſe before I leave them to ſpeak ſomething to thoſe two points, which all of them are content to take upon themſelves as a Characteriſtick diſtinction from any other Sect. Let us then conſider, Firſt, whether it be lawfull to baptize any infant; Secondly, whether ſprinkling be ſufficient, or if it be neceſſary to dip over head and eares all who are baptized?</p>
            <p>Concerning the ſtate of the firſt Queſtion,<note place="margin">The ſtate of the firſt queſtion.</note> we need not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert the quality of the infants to be baptized, Whether they
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:124957:88"/> muſt be the children of true beleevers, or onely of profeſſors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcandall; whether of Church members only, or if it be enough that their Parents be Chriſtians in the largeſt ſignification, all this belongs to another place. The onely point pertinent here, is, Whether any infants may be baptized? The champions for the Anabaptiſts ſide in their Declaration of the publick Diſpute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by them with the City Miniſters for their Tenet, ſet down their Theſe in theſe expreſſe terms, No infants ought to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; The formall contradiction hereof is, Some infants ought to be baptized: for this Poſition, I propone ſome few Scripturall reaſons. Who have leiſure to ſee this point debated at length, may look upon the worthy and judicious Writs of M. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> M. <hi>Black,</hi> M. <hi>Geere.</hi> M. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> alſo in his laſt Writ, and M. <hi>Cotton</hi> in his lateſt, learnedly and zealouſly maintain this truth againſt the Anabaptiſts.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The firſt reaſon for the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note>My firſt reaſon I frame thus, Who ever have a good right to the firſt Sacrament of the New Teſtament ought to be baptized: But ſome infants have a good right to the firſt Sacrament of the New Teſtament: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Some infants ought to be baptized. The <hi>major</hi> is naturally clear, it needs no more for its proof but the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the terms of the Propoſition, for Baptiſm and the firſt Sacrament of the New Teſtament are one thing, and ought to be baptized is nothing elſe but to have a good right to Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Who have right to the chief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes have right to ſome of the ſeals which God has appointed to be a means of aſſurance of theſe promiſes, unleſſe the Lord himſelf have made a ſpeciall exception.</note>All the queſtion lies in the <hi>minor,</hi> which thus I prove, Who ever have right to the chief promiſes of the New Teſtament, they have right to the firſt Sacrament of the New Teſtament, if the Lord have not put ſome impediment to their participation of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; But ſome infants have right to the chief promiſes of the New Teſtament, and the Lord has put no impediment to their participation of that Sacrament: <hi>Ergo.</hi> About the <hi>major</hi> I ſee one, and but one, makes ſome velitation, all the reſt give it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for it is grounded likewiſe on the nature of the terms of the propoſition, the chief promiſes of the New Teſtament and the firſt Sacrament; this is the ſign and ſeal, that the thing ſignified. The reaſon proceeds not from every thing ſignified to every ſign, but from the chief thing ſignified to the firſt ſign: ſome of the bleſſings which Circumciſion did ſeal, belonged to <hi>Melchiſedek,</hi> to <hi>Lot,</hi> to <hi>Job,</hi> and others who were not ſo farre as we reade cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, but the main promiſes ſealed by Circumciſion, <hi>In thy
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:124957:88"/> ſeed all the Nations of the earth ſhall be bleſſed;</hi> The Meſſias com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the poſterity of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Covenant of grace as it was adminiſtred under the figures of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law, did belong to the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> alone, and to the proſelytes who joyned themſelves to their body. Nor do we ſpeak but of the firſt ſign, for unleſſe there be a right to this, there is a right to none, and where the Lord has appointed ſignes to ſeal up thereby the aſſurance of his promiſes, to deny to them whom God wil have to be aſſured of the promiſe, the uſe of all the ſeals, which he has inſtituted to be the ſpirituall means of that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, were on mans part a great unjuſtice, except the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf have put a barre to the participation of theſe ſeals, as in the Sacrament of Circumciſion of old he did to women, and to male infants before the eighth day, and to all born in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe during the time of their fourty years wandering therein.</p>
            <p>But it is upon the <hi>minor</hi> that our Adverſaries beſtir themſelves to purpoſe: they deny ſtoutly both its parts,<note place="margin">Infants have good right to the promiſes of the Covenant of grace.</note> all the Scripturall objections which they can make againſt infants baptiſm, they count impediments put by God to paedobaptiſm; and upon this ground they deny the laſt part of the <hi>minor;</hi> this we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider when we come to anſwer their objections, it were not ſo pertinent in this place. The firſt part likewiſe of the <hi>minor</hi> they deny, affirming that no infants have right to any promiſe of the New Teſtament before the time of their actuall faith, which they ſay cannot poſſibly be in them before the years of their diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This is the greateſt and moſt dangerous knot in the whole debate, for we do not ſo much contend for the outward Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to infants, as for their ſpirituall right in God and his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: all our adverſaries deny to all infants all right in God, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſes in his promiſes and Covenant, as much as they do to Turks and Pagans: Some of both (ſay they) may be elected and ſaved, but neither of both have any place in the Covenant of grace or any Goſpel promiſes, till they be called by the Word, and by an actuall faith have embraced the Goſpel. If therefore we make good the right and intereſt of any infants in the chief promiſes of the New Teſtament, we eſtabliſh the main hinge of this whole controverſie. For this end we will endeavour to clear from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture theſe four propoſitions; Firſt, that the infants of the Jews had reall and true intereſt in the Covenant of grace, even before
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:124957:89"/> the comming of Chriſt; Secondly, that the infants of the Jews had that ſame right in the Covenant of grace, after the comming of Chriſt in the New Teſtament; Thirdly, that the infants of the Gentiles under the old Teſtament, when their Parents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came proſelytes, had right to the Covenant of grace; Fourthly, that the infants of the Gentiles under the New Teſtament had that ſame right continued.</p>
            <p>The firſt we prove from <hi>Geneſis</hi> 17. <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 12, 13.<note place="margin">The infants of the Jews had reall intereſt in the Covenant of grace before the comming of Chriſt. Gen. 17.7, 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant betwixt me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee in their generations for an everlaſting Covenant to be a God unto thee and to thy ſeed after thee: And he that is eight days old ſhall be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed among you, and my Covenant ſhall be in all your fleſh.</hi> Here God enters in Covenant, and promiſes not only things temporall, but the chief of all ſpirituall bleſſings, that he will be a God to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſeed as well as to himſelfe; and this his ſeed is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of infants as well as others, for with all theſe this Covenant is made, who carried the ſeal of it in their fleſh, and ſome of theſe are expreſly ſaid to be but eight days old: this gracious Covenant was the ground of their Circumciſion, and of all the legal ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies exerciſed about them as true members of the Jewiſh Church: The firſt males were holy to the Lord, Chriſt as was the cuſtome of other infants was brought to the Temple, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Luke 2.</note> to be preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Lord and to have a ſacrifice offered for him; in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond command the Lord promiſes mercy to the children of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full parents, not only in the third and fourth, but in the thouſand generation; and although the Parents were wicked, yet the Lord acknowledges his intereſt in the Jewiſh children, and theirs in him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20, 21.<note place="margin">Ezek 16.20, 21</note> 
               <hi>Moreover thou haſt taken thy ſons and thy daughters whom thou haſt born unto me, and theſe haſt thou ſacrificed unto them to be devoured, thou haſt ſlain my children.</hi> Here the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh infants burnt by their idolatrous Parents and ſacrificed to <hi>Molech,</hi> are called Gods children, and are ſaid to be born to God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond propoſition, the continuance of this right to the Jewiſh infants under the Goſpel: ſome deny it, but abſurdly; for Chriſt when he came was a Mediator of a better Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22.<note place="margin">Alſo after Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming under the new Teſtament. Heb. 7.27.8, 6.</note> 
               <hi>By ſo much was Jeſus made a ſurety of a better Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and 8.6. <hi>He is the Mediator of a better Covenant which was eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes.</hi> The Covenant of grace for the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:124957:89"/> ſubſtance was ever the ſame, but for the manner of its adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was the longer the better, and after Chriſts incarnation beſt of all: but it had been evidently worſe after that time in a very great and main particular, if all Jewiſh infants which before were Church-members and partakers of the ſacrifices and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the elect ones of them were of the ſpirituall promiſes, ſhould have loſt theſe priviledges, after the comming of Chriſt; and have been ſo far then unchurched, that neither Covenant, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, Promiſe, nor any ſuch benefit could belong to them before their years of diſcretion. But they who are reſolute to controvert this point, I hope will be content to be ſilenced by the Apoſtles determination,<note place="margin">Acts 2.39.</note> 
               <hi>The promiſe is unto you and to your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:</hi> It is a vain eluſion to ſay, the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of the promiſes of the extraordinary gifts of the holy Ghoſt, for infants are leſſe capable of thoſe then of any graces and gifts in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie; alſo it is evident that the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of the great promiſe of making Jeſus crucified and riſen from the dead, Lord and Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 36. the Author of remiſſion of ſins, <hi>v.</hi> 38. of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>v.</hi> 31. as well as of the extraordinary gifts of the holy Ghoſt. Neither is their evaſion better who would have no other children here underſtood then theſe who are called, for ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remiſſion of ſins, nor ſalvation, nor Chriſt, nor any gracious promiſe, ſhould belong at all to any child of <hi>Abraham</hi> before he were called, no not to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> nor <hi>Jacob,</hi> the children of the promiſe, in the time of their infancy, which is expreſly contrary to the former Scripture, and to the common ſenſe of all well adviſed Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>As for the third propoſition, the right of proſelyte infants under the Law to the Covenant and the Sacrament which then did ſeal it; it is clear from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12.<note place="margin">The Infants of proſelyte Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles under the old Teſtament had right in the Covenant of grace. Gen. 17.12.</note> 
               <hi>He that is eight days old ſhall be circumciſed among you every man-child in your generations, he that is born in the houſe, or bought with money of any ſtranger which is not of thy ſeed.</hi> The infants of ſtrangers bought with mony though not of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, are commanded to bear the ſign of the Covenant of the Lord in their fleſh. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48, 49.<note place="margin">Ex. 12.48, 49.</note> 
               <hi>When a ſtranger ſhall ſojourn with thee, and will keep the Paſſeover to the Lord, let all his males be circumciſed, and then let him come neer and keep it, and he ſhall be as one born in the Land, one Law ſhall be to him that is home-born, and one to the ſtranger that ſojourneth
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:124957:90"/> among you.</hi> Here the ſtranger Gentile, who is deſired to joyn, is admitted to the ſame Law and priviledge with the Jew.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Infants of believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have right in the Covenant of grace.</note>For the fourth, that the infants of beleeving Gentiles have right to the promiſes of God under the New Teſtament, it is clear from what is ſaid: for if it were otherwiſe, then their condition after Chriſts incarnation ſhould be much worſe then before, which may not be admitted: but however this may be, many places in the New Teſtament will decide the quarrell, I cite but two, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.24.<note place="margin">Rom. 11.24.</note> 
               <hi>For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree, which is wild by nature, and were graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more ſhall theſe which be the naturall branches be graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed into their own olive tree?</hi> Here the whole Church of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles is graffed into the root of the naturall olive, and that the more room might be left for them the Jews are broken off. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the breaking off of the Jewiſh branches ſome of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were ingraffed with them in the root Chriſt, and then the infants of the Gentiles as well as their Parents enjoyed the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the new Covenant; when the body of the Jews is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, to this end that the Gentiles may grow in their place; ſhall not the Gentiles then enjoy the Jewiſh priviledge, at leaſt their own priviledge which themſelves enjoyed in worſe times? for as we have ſhewed, under the Law the infants both of Jews and Gentile proſelytes did live by the fatneſſe of the root, as well as their Parents: The manifold windings and turnings of the adverſary from this place, does but wrap them the further in the net.</p>
            <p>The next place I cite is the firſt of the <hi>Cor.</hi> 7 14.<note place="margin">How infants are holy. 1 Cor. 7.14.</note> 
               <hi>For the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving husband is ſanctified by the wife, and the unbeleeving wife is ſanctified by the Husband, elſe were your children unclean, but now are they holy.</hi> Here the children of Chriſtians are affirmed to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, ſeparated and dedicated to the ſervice of God, as thoſe who are in Covenant with him, to whom he is a God and whom he takes for his people: for the Church in the Old Teſtament, both young and old, were accounted a holy and ſeparate people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.1, 2. <hi>Ye are the children of the Lord your God, thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God, and the Lord hath choſen thee to be a peculiar people unto himſelfe above all the Nations that are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth.</hi> Iſaiah 63.18. <hi>The people of thy holineſſe have poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it but a little while:</hi> This priviledge continues to the Church
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:124957:90"/> in the New Teſtament to the worlds end, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>But ye are a choſen generation, a royall Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar people, which in time paſt were not a people, but are now the people of God.</hi> The Anabaptiſts for to looſe the knot of this argument, endeavour with much paine to caſt a miſt of confuſion upon the whole text; but to make clear and ſhort work with them we reaſon thus, The holineſſe ſpoken of by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> here, is one of three, either the holineſſe of juſtification and inherent ſanctification flowing from the application of the bloud of Chriſt, and inhabitation of the holy Ghoſt; or elſe a civill ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of legitimation flowing from the lawfulneſſe of a juſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony; or elſe a foederall holineſſe, whereby the whole church of God, young and old, by vertue of his covenant with them are ſeparate and dedicated unto him; no other ſenſes uſe to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the word holy in this place by any diſputant: the firſt two are inconſiſtent with the text, the third therefore muſt be received. The firſt cannot be approved by any who is ſound in the doctrine of juſtification and ſanctification: for who ever will make all the children of every beleeving parent to have the holineſſe of a reall juſtification and ſanctification, muſt either recall this tenet, or in the end cannot but join with the Papiſts and Arminians in their great article of totall and finall apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie from the moſt ſaving grace.</p>
            <p>As for the ſecond ſenſe, we deny that ever in Scripture chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are called holy, becauſe begotten in lawfull marriage: for ſo the children of the greateſt Idolaters and worſt of the Pagans, who have no relation at all to God, but as ſinfull creatures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to Idols; that is, of creatures very unholy, and at beſt meerly naturall and civill, muſt be accounted holy according to Scripture. 2. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of an holineſſe which belongs to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> children, from this, that one of their parents is a beleever; Legitimation cannot be ſuch an holineſſe, for the faith of one or both parents contributes nothing to that; the children of two unbeleevers are as lawfull as the children of two beleevers, and ſo as holy in ſuch a ſenſe. But the holineſſe whereof the Apoſtle is there ſpeaking, is ſuch whereof the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of parents who are both unbeleevers are not capable, for it belongs to the children by vertue of the faith of one of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: So this civill holineſſe of legitimation, if there were any
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:124957:91"/> ſuch, could not agree to the Apoſtles words in hand.</p>
            <p>The firſt two ſenſes being removed from the words, onely the third does remain, a foederall holineſſe, whereby the children are joined with God in covenant, and dedicated to the ſervice of God by vertue of that covenant, as well as their parents. Such an holineſſe is a good reaſon of that which goes before, and a ſolid ground of ſolution of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſcruple which the Apoſtle is looſing: they had propounded to the Apoſtle their doubt, If a beleeving husband might lawfully cohabit with his unbeleeving wife; the Apoſtles anſwer is affirmative: and the reaſon of the anſwer is, becauſe what ever the unbeleeving par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may be in themſelves, yet their cohabitation is ſanctified to beleevers, and of this ſanctification the holineſſe of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is brought for an evidence, ſince the Lord counted their children holy and in covenant with him, the beleevers might reſt aſſured that their abode with their companions (though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving) was acceptable unto God.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle here is ſpeaking of husbands and wives, not of men and whores, though ſome other Scriptures ſhould prove the baſtards of beleevers to be holy, yet this Scripture ſpeaks nothing either of them or of their holineſſe, or of any thing elſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them: only to ſettle the conſcience of beleeving husbands and wives, concerning their lawfull abode and ſanctified cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with their unbeleeving companions, the foederal holines of their children is brought in for a proof. To have ſaid that children was lawful, was no more then that their marriage was lawful, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was not the queſtion: but to ſay that the children of their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full marriage were holy, did infer not onely the lawfulneſſe of the marriage, but the ſanctified uſe of the marriage, and that now their cohabitation was without ſin and acceptable to God.</p>
            <p>My ſecond argument I take from infants Circumciſion,<note place="margin">The ſecond argument is from the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of Infants.</note> which thus I frame. Circumciſion was adminiſtred to infants under the Law. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Baptiſme ought to be adminiſtred to infants under the Goſpel. Nothing here is doubtfull but the conſequence, which thus I prove. Baptiſme under the Goſpel ſucceeds to Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion under the Law. <hi>Ergo,</hi> if Circumciſion was miniſtred to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants under the Law, Baptiſme ought to be miniſtred to infants under the Goſpel. Both the conſequence and the antecedent of this argument are denyed.</p>
            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:124957:91"/>
            <p>When for the proof of the conſequence we bring in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule of reaſoning from analogy and proportion,<note place="margin">It is ſafe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume from Scripturall conſequences, yea, proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> theſe of the adverſaries who prove to be ſo great diſputers as to challenge the chief Miniſters of the City to publick debates, doe deny to us all ſuch rules of diſputation, and which is much worſe, avow their miſ-regard of what ever conſequence we are able to fetch from any Scripture by the rules of the righteſt reaſon; leading us directly to that baſe and brutall fancy of the Jeſuite <hi>Veron,</hi> who for a time did pleaſe himſelf to admit from Proteſtants in all controverſies, no conſequences at all, but onely expreſſe, formall, and ſyllabick texts. Though the Jeſuits themſelves did cry down and cruſh this irrationall &amp; inhumane conceit of their colleague, yet the Anabaptiſts, among many more exploded and ſopited errors, ſhew their boldneſſe to renue this alſo; but in this madnes, their learned friend M. <hi>Tombs</hi> deſerts them; for he only admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es us to be ſparing &amp; cautious in our reaſoning from proportion in poſitive and inſtitute worſhip: his advice we mind to follow as very reaſonable: for we doe not from analogy infer the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Baptiſme, or any other poſitive worſhip, onely the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Baptiſme, a worſhip inſtituted by an expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to a certain ſubject, to wit, infants; and to reaſon thus far, yea farther from proportions and analogies is the frequent cuſtome both of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; thus the Lord proves it lawfull for his Diſciples to pluck the ears of corn on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, from <hi>Davids</hi> eating of the ſhew-bread: and the Apoſtle proves the neceſſity of maintaining the Miniſters, from not muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corn, and their living by the Altar who ſerve at the Altar, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt ſtick is upon the antecedent, Baptiſmes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to Circumciſion; we therefore prove it from <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12.<note place="margin">Baptiſme ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. Col. 2.11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>In whom alſo ye are circumciſed with the circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſinnes of the fleſh by the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Chriſt: buried with him in Baptiſme, wherein alſo you are riſen with him.</hi> The Apoſtle here ſhewing our compleatneſſe in Chriſt, tels us that we have in him the main thing ſignified by Circumciſion, the ſpirituall Circumciſion of the heart not made with hands, the putting off of the body of ſin: alſo that in place of the aboliſhed rite of Circumciſion we have the new rite of Baptiſme, whoſe ſubſtance and ſignification was the very ſame
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:124957:92"/> with Circumciſion, a buriall with Chriſt, and a reſurrection with him, a killing of the body of ſin, and quickning of the new man in the life of every grace. The Apoſtle in this his parallel and compariſon of the two Sacraments is clear, in making the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and ſignification of both to be really one. In this alſo that Circumciſion is put away, and accompliſhed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, the body of all the old ſhadows; but that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme yet remains in the Chriſtian church in place of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, having the ſame ends and ſignifications therewith. Many diſſimilitudes are here brought by ſome to hinder all propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, analogy, and parallel betwixt theſe two Sacraments, but how many ſoever can be brought they will prove no more but that thoſe two are not one, which was never affirmed by any: things that are like and agree onely in ſome third cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be one, for identity deſtroys analogy and ſimilitude.</p>
            <p>But if two concordances betwixt Baptiſme and Circumciſion be made good, the third for which we reaſon will of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord follow, if it be clear that Circumciſion and Baptiſme be both of them ſeals of the ſame covenant; and both of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiating ſeals; it follows that if infants were capable of the one, they are alſo of the other. If the firſt two doe not clearly enough appear from the laſt paſſage of the Apoſtle, there be many more Scriptures beſide to make them evident.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſimilitude betwixt Baptiſme and Circumciſion is, their ſealing of the covenant of grace,<note place="margin">Circumciſion did ſeal the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace.</note> and the bleſſings therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; this of Baptiſme was never queſtioned, but of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion the Anabaptiſts did ever deny it; we prove it firſt from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11.<note place="margin">Gen. 17.11.</note> 
               <hi>and it ſhall be a token of the covenant between me and thee;</hi> what covenant was this whereof Circumciſion is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a token? (or as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. a ſign and a ſeal) <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſſes it in the 7. <hi>v.</hi> calling it an everlaſting covenant, wherein God promiſed to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his ſeed after him: this covenant muſt be of grace, ſince the Lord the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of grace and glory promiſes therein to communicate even himſelf to <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſterity. It is true, according to the wiſe and wonderfull diſpenſation of the grace of God, both under the Law and Goſpel, the promiſe is preached to the whole ſeed, and all the members of the viſible church whether elect or repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; but what is offered to all in the Word and Sacraments, is
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:124957:92"/> conferred onely upon the elect by the efficacy of his grace who works all in all according to the good pleaſure of his will.</p>
            <p>It is clear alſo from <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6.<note place="margin">Deut. 30.6.</note> that Circumciſion was a ſeal of the covenant of grace, <hi>and the Lord thy God will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy ſoul that thou mayeſt live;</hi> here the thing ſignified by the rite of Circumciſion is the ſanctification of the Spirit, and the planting of the love of God in the mortified heart, which without all doubt are two of the principal promiſes of the covenant of grace.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.<note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> is ſo clear that in reaſon it ought to ſtop all mouths from farther debating in this point, <hi>and he received the ſign of Circumciſion a ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of faith.</hi> Whence we reaſon, The covenant that brings to Goſpel juſtification, to the righteouſneſſe of faith, to remiſſion of ſins and happineſſe, is the covenant of grace. But the Apoſtle there affirms Circumciſion to have been a ſeal of ſuch a covenant. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's true, the covenant of grace,<note place="margin">The covenant of grace has been diverſly adminiſtred, but ever the ſame and never mixed.</note> in its adminiſtration before Chriſts comming in the fleſh, was cloathed with many ſhadows of now aboliſhed ceremonies, and had adjoined to it upon mount <hi>Sinai</hi> the old covenant of works to be a ſevere paedagogue for the pointing out the way to Chriſt, unto the very unruly children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and for keeping them in awe and terrour by its threats and curſes; alſo for alluring them to obedience by its temporall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: we grant becauſe of thoſe adjuncts the covenant of grace is ſometimes ſpoken of as an old covenant, and is diſtinguiſhed from its very ſelf as it was adminiſtred by Chriſt after his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the old dreſſe of <hi>Sinai</hi> being changed as of an old gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but that the thing was ever the ſame, adviſed Chriſtians muſt be loath to doubt, for if the covenant which the Lord made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed under the Law be not truly and ſubſtantially the new covenant of grace, we deſire to know by what means they obtained either grace or glory: and to put all the Fathers of the Old Teſtament in ſo beaſtly a condition as excludes from grace and glory, who dare be ſo inſolent? Now if we grant them a covenant which did bring them to a ſtate of grace in this life, and of glory hereafter, how can we deny it to be gracious?</p>
            <p>That which they ſpeak of a mixed covenant is not much to the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:124957:93"/> purpoſe, we did never deny the adjunction of ceremonies and temporall promiſes, and the whole covenant of works unto the covenant of grace under its firſt adminiſtration: yea, under the very New Teſtament where the adminiſtration is much changed, the new covenant wants not both its ſacramentall ceremonies and the promiſes of this life; but none of thoſe adjuncts doe change the ſtate and nature of the principall; it remains ever a covenant of pure grace without any mixture; it is neither in the whole, nor in any ſubſtantiall part turned into a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works; it may not loſe its denomination if it keeps its nature; it may neither be counted wholly a covenant of works, nor a mixed covenant of grace and works.</p>
            <p>For the other part of the ſimilitude that Circumciſion and Baptiſme as they are ſeals of the ſame covenant, ſo they are both initiating ſeals,<note place="margin">Both Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme are initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating ſeals.</note> ceremonies whereby the firſt ſolemn entry into this covenant is made, is ſcarce controverted by any; of circumciſion the thing is evident, whatever covenant it ſealed it was an initiating ſeal thereof; for it was the very firſt ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exerciſed about any perſon: they of age at their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the faith were circumciſed, and infants in the eight day of their life; no uncircumciſed perſon might enter the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle or Temple, or eat of the Paſchall ſupper. The ſame is true of Baptiſme, upon thoſe of age who profeſſe faith, Chriſt immediately puts Baptiſme, <hi>Goe preach and baptize:</hi> none may participate of the Lords Supper who is not before baptized: this was the order of the Apoſtolick Churches, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38.41, 42. The Apoſtle exhorts his hearers, firſt to repent and be baptized: this being done, thereafter they goe to the breaking of bread. M. <hi>Tombs</hi> the over-turner of this order is deſerted herein, as in many other of his notions, by all the Anabaptiſts I know.</p>
            <p>Thus the parts of the analogy which we touch upon are made good, as for our inference that Baptiſme being an initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſign of the ſame covenant in which Circumciſion initiates, therefore as Circumciſion was adminiſtred to infants in their ſolemn admiſſion to the covenant under the Law; ſo bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme ought to bee adminiſtred to infants in their ſolemn admiſſion to the ſame covenant under the Goſpel. The main things objected againſt this concluſion are two; firſt, that neither under Law nor Goſpel infants were admitted to any
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:124957:93"/> covenant of grace. I grant if this exception were made not to the concluſion which is an informal way of anſwering, but to the conſequence or antecedent or ſome propoſition, it is very rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant if it were true; but in the former argument I have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated from divers clear Scriptures its falſhood.</p>
            <p>Their other exception is,<note place="margin">There needs not a particular command for the application of a ſacrament to the divers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and ſexes, and conditions of perſons.</note> that the parallel were it moſt harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious in never ſo many things, yet if it be to the purpoſe, it muſt hold alſo in this, that as Circumciſion had an expreſs command for its application to infants, ſo muſt Baptiſm. We anſwer, that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is the very point in queſtion, which this whole argument and the former, and all that follows intend to prove; that for the application of Baptiſm to infants, there is ſo much of a divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment as is requiſite in ſuch a caſe. That expreſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands are not required for the application of ordinances to the diverſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſexes and conditions of ſubjects, is clear in a number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: Who ever did require a particular command, or expreſſe inſtitution for admitting of women to the Lords Supper? for the baptiſme of old men, the baptiſme of Kings, of Queens, of Merchants, and ſo forth? If the premiſes therefore be granted as we have proved them from Scripture, that infants are in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, that Circumciſion was, and Baptiſme is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall ſeal, initiating and ſolemnly bringing into this covenant all who are admitted thereto; and that Circumciſion did ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate infants therein, it will not in reaſon be avoided, but Baptiſme muſt ſtill do the ſame, and that to deny Baptiſme the initiating ſeal of the covenant of grace to infants, is nothing elſe but the excluding of them from the covenant of grace it ſelf.</p>
            <p>It is M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Tombes</hi> remark, that under the very Law Baptiſm was in uſe,<note place="margin">Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme under the Law.</note> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Marſhall</hi> addes very judiciouſly from the Talmud from <hi>Maimonides</hi> and other Authors, that who ever were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed among the <hi>Jews</hi> were alſo baptized, infants as well as their parents, women as well as men. That this cuſtome of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing all who were added to the church, children as well as parents, did conſtantly continue in all ages of the Chriſtian church, is proved by many without any ſatisfactory reply; but we intend here to diſpute from Scripture alone.</p>
            <p>Our third argument we take from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.<note place="margin">The third argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Mat. 28.19.</note>

Now that the covenant and promiſe in the very tearms of it concerned infants as much as any, appears by the words of God to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>I will be thy God and the God of thy ſeed;</hi> and <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 2.39. does preach expreſly, that this promiſe did belong as well to his hearers children as to themſelves.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">All who are baptized needs not be capable of teaching.</note>The great objection againſt al this, is this argument; None are the objects of baptiſme, but who firſt are the objects of teaching; But infants are not the objects of teaching. <hi>Ergo.</hi> We anſwer, that both the propoſitions may be denyed, there is no neceſſity of the major, for although the commiſſion of teaching and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing goe together, yet this infers not any neceſſity of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe two commands to the ſelf ſame perſons; be it ſo that theſe two acts are ever conjoined, and that teaching muſt ever goe before baptizing, for the parents ought to be inſtructed before the children be baptized, and in the right adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of baptiſme, the nature of the covenant is always declared before the ſeal of the ſacrament be appended; yet it follows not
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:124957:95"/> that the ſame perſons who are to be baptized, are at that ſame time to be taught: as in the commiſſion for Circumciſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. all the precepts concern not the ſelf ſame perſons, but ſome the parents onely, ſome the infants only, and ſome both, <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>he that is eight days old ſhall be circumciſed among you;</hi> this belongs onely to infants, but the 11. <hi>v. ye ſhall circumciſe the fleſh of your fore-skin,</hi> this belongs onely to the parents, and thoſe of age, for no other could obey this injunction: and <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>every man-child among you ſhall be circumciſed,</hi> belongs alike both to old &amp; young. Even ſo that in the Law of Baptiſm ſome of the injunctions ſhould belong only to the Paſtors, as the act of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and baptizing and others, onely to the elder people that are to be baptized, as that of being taught; and others, as that of being baptized, to the younger alſo who are not able to bee taught, there is no abſurdity.</p>
            <p>The minor alſo is denyed upon divers grounds.<note place="margin">Infants are Diſciples.</note> I ſpeak not of that which divers maintain of the actuall faith of children, and of the application to infants, of that of <hi>Iſaiah; they ſhall be all taught of God, from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi> But I deſire that to be conſidered, which many more affirm, and divers of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts themſelves doe preſſe, that the word which Chriſt uſes in his commiſſion to the Apoſtles is, <hi>matheteuein,</hi> which ſignifies ſay they, not to teach, but to make Diſciples; now infants may very well goe under the name of Diſciples, for they are brought to the School of God, the viſible Church, and there they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate to Gods diſcipline, and have their names given up to be the Lords ſubjects and ſcholars. Sundry ſcriptures alſo are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced where infants are counted Diſciples, as <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10. <hi>why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the Diſciples?</hi> Circumciſion is the yoke whereof the Apoſtle is ſpeaking, now they on whoſe neck ordinarily that yoke was put were onely infants.</p>
            <p>A third reaſon for the proving of our firſt minor, is this,<note place="margin">Infants have intereſt in the Trinity.</note> To whom the form and end of Baptiſme expreſſed in the place in hand does belong, to them the commiſſion ſet down in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. does extend; But to ſome infants the form and end of Baptiſme expreſſed in that place does belong. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The minor is grounded upon the words of the text, for they make the form and end of Baptiſme to be a dedication of the perſon baptized to the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, and an intereſſing of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:124957:96"/> three Perſons in the baptized party: now the neceſſity to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate chriſtian infants to their Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the intereſt of all the three Perſons in the infants of their ſervants ſo dedicated unto them is evident.</p>
            <p>A fourth reaſon for the probation of that firſt minor, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever may lawfully be baptized to them,<note place="margin">Infants may be lawfully baptized.</note> the commiſſion in hand does extend; for the baptiſm of women, of old men, of Kings, of Beggers, and of all ſexes, ages, and conditions, is grounded upon this command, though neither their names nor their qualities be therein expreſly ſet down, nor can be fetched fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, but only by conſquence. Now we aſſume, that ſome infants may lawfully be baptized: this, both the preſent argument and the two former, and theſe that follow, doe prove, and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 2.39. does evince by this argument, To whom the chief ground of Baptiſme does belong they may lawfully be baptized; But to ſome children the chief ground of baptiſme does belong, to wit, the promiſes of the new covenant: thoſe ſays he, belong to you and to your children; and upon this as a principall foundation he builds his exhortation to them to be baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Arg. 4. from the Baptiſm of whole families.</note>Our fourth main argument is this, The bleſſing which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows on whole families without exception of any infant, ought not to be denyed to all infants; But baptiſme is ſuch a bleſſing. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The major is grounded on that laudable conformity which ought to be in all men with God; when hee is good, our eye without reproof may not be evill: the minor is proved from divers Scriptures, where the Apoſtles did baptize, not only them who are declared to beleeve, but with them their whole houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, whoſe actuall beleeving is not at all expreſſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15.<note place="margin">Acts 16.15.31</note>

How great a wrong it were to exclude infants either from the promiſe or from the ſeal of ſalvation, when both are conferred upon whole houſholds, whereof infants are the moſt innocent parts, may be ſeen in all the preceding practiſes of God, from the firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of any initiating ſign to that day; What ever man, either <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> was moved by God to joine himſelf to the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble church, as himſelf did hear and make profeſſion of his faith, and receive the ſeal of Circumciſion, ſo alſo all his male infants were circumciſed, though they could neither hear nor beleeve. This bounty and kindneſſe God did never afterward retract, and for any man to doe it, it were a great preſumption; for ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> in the New Teſtament where their comforts are enlarged ſhould be in a more ſorrowfull condition then the very <hi>Gentiles</hi> were in the Old; for then the Proſelytes upon the profeſſion of their faith, had all their infants though unable to beleeve, taken within the covenant, and all their children admitted to the ſeals thereof; but according to our adverſaries poſition, the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves in the New Teſtament, though never ſo zealous of the faith, muſt have all their children excluded, not onely from the ſeals, but from the covenant it ſelf, and all its gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes either of grace or glory, and from every ſpirituall bleſſing. It muſt be a very clear Scripture that ought to perſwade ſo great a change of Gods adminiſtration of his covenant, and its ſeals ſo much to the worſe of that which is confeſſed was before his uſuall practiſe and command.</p>

                  </gap>ken off.</note>To this argument three things are anſwered; Firſt, that the children mentioned were not infants, but grown to ſuch years as made them capable of inſtruction. Secondly, that their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing was not ſpirituall but a temporall health. Thirdly, that the ſign and ſeal mentioned is not baptiſme but impoſition of hands. To the firſt we reply, that the children were not of ſo many years as made them capable of inſtruction, for the text cals them expreſly young and little ones. Secondly, they were ſo young, that they could not walk, they were brought to Chriſt, they did not come but in the arms of their parents; Chriſt alſo took them up in his own arms. Thirdly, if they had been capable of inſtruction, the Apoſtles could not have been offended, for they knew that it was their maſters office and delight to inſtruct all who were capable, and the comming of ſuch to the great Doctor could have given no offence.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond, the text gives not the leaſt hint that any bodily cure was either required or given. Secondly, the bleſſings given were ſuch, as Chriſt is deſired to ſeek from the Father by prayer, and theſe could not but be the beſt bleſſings, even ſpirituall and everlaſting. Thirdly, it's expreſſed in the place, that the greateſt of all bleſſings was theirs, even the very kingdome of heaven. While this is denyed by the adverſaries affirming that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven belongs not to infants, but onely to thoſe who are like them; the text refels this their ſhift; for the kingdome of heaven muſt belong much more to themſelves then to ſuch who were onely like them. The ſcope and intention of Chriſt in this place is not to ſpeak of the condition of others like to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, but of infants themſelves, who were unjuſtly ſtopped by
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:124957:97"/> the Apoſtles to come to him, and the Lord is pleading for the admiſſion onely of infants to him upon this reaſon, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven belonged to ſuch, which had been an impertinent argument for his concluſion, if heaven had not belonged to infants at all, who upon this reaſon are required to be admitted to him. Farther, if infants were to be admitted to Chriſt, becauſe heaven belonged to theſe, who reſembled them in ſome qualities, it would follow that doves, lambs, ſerpents, ſtones, and trees might have been brought to him upon this reaſon as well as infants; for men reſembling theſe creatures in their good qualities are to goe to heaven.</p>
            <p>As for their third anſwer it is very true, that the ſigne in the place alledged was not baptiſm, this was never alledged; for we read nothing of the baptiſm of the parents of theſe infants who were preſented to Chriſt; as yet the command of baptiſm was not made ſo publick as afterward, when the Lord at his aſcenſion ſent out his Diſciples in the power of the holy Ghoſt to gather a form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church, and to baptize beleevers and their children; the reaſon proceeded not from baptiſme, but to baptiſme, and that <hi>à loco diſparatorum;</hi> ſince impoſition of hands, a ſeal of Chriſts grace and bleſſing, and of the kingdome of heaven belonged to infants; that therefore baptiſme a ſeal of that ſame kind, when once the Lord had ſolemnly at his aſcenſion appointed it to be the ordinary ſeal of initiation into his Church, ought not to be denyed unto them.</p>

                  </gap>over brethren, I would not that ye ſhould be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all paſſed through the ſea: and were all baptized unto</hi> Moſes <hi>in the cloud and in the Sea.</hi> The Fathers baptized in the cloud, and in the ſea were the whole people as well young as old; for no doubt the infants went as well through the cloud and the ſea as their parents. The conſequence is proved thus; the reaſons which may be brought for the excluſion of infants from being baptized with their parents by Chriſts baptiſme, militar, as much againſt their being baptized with their parents by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> baptiſme. Therefore if notwithſtanding they were admitted
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:124957:98"/> to the one baptiſme, they may as well be admitted to the other. If it be ſaid that the infants did with their parents in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe eat of the Manna and drink of the rock, yet may they not now be admitted with their parents to eat and drink at the Lords Table: We anſwer, there is no ſuch neceſſary evidence of the infants eating of the Manna and drinking of the rock, as of their paſſing through the cloud and ſea; this neceſſity was ſimple and abſolute, the other not ſo; for infants may live on their mothers breaſts and the milk of cattle, without either eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bread or drinking of water: but however, there is a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive precept that hinders them from participation of the Lords Supper; they cannot remember the Lords death, they cannot examine the ſtate of their own heart; no ſuch impediment is put in their way by the hand of God to keep them from bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. M. <hi>Tombes</hi> obſerves it, that long before <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> days, baptiſme was in uſe among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and M. <hi>Marſhal</hi> adds from the Talmud, <hi>Maimonides</hi> and other Authors, that it was a very ancient cuſtome to baptize all that were circumciſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants as wel as their parents, women as well as men; and that this cuſtome of baptizing all that were added to the Church, as well children as others, did continue in all ages among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, is proved at length by many without any ſatisfactory reply: but we intend here to diſpute from Scripture alone.</p>

               <note place="margin">7. Argument. Infants are partakers of remiſſion, of regeneration, of life eternal.</note>Wee ſhall bring but one other reaſon and ſo paſſe on, To whom the Lord gives the whole ſignification of baptiſme, from theſe, men ought not to withhold the outward ſign thereof; But to ſome infants the Lord gives the whole ſignification of baptiſm. For the proof of the <hi>major</hi> we need not alledge the equity of giving the leſſe to them that gets the more, of not denying the ſhell and the cask to them who enjoy the kirnell and the pearl; for the Apoſtles words prove it ſufficiently, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47.<note place="margin">Acts 10.47.</note> 
               <hi>Can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man forbid water that theſe ſhould not be baptized which have received the holy Ghoſt as well as we? and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord;</hi> the Apoſtle here reaſons from one part of the ſignification of baptiſme, and that but a temporary bleſſing, the extraordinacy gifts of the holy Ghoſt, to the outward ſign of baptiſme, how much more may we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it from its whole ordinary ſignification? The ground of this reaſon is granted by the principall of our adverſaries, who profeſs their
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:124957:98"/> willingneſſe to baptize any infants of whom they were certain that they had the ſaving graces of the holy Ghoſt, &amp; avow their excluſion of infants from baptiſm upon this ground mainly, that they beleeve, they are excluded from the covenant of grace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, the ſaving graces of the Spirit, till in the years of diſcretion they be brought actually to beleeve.</p>
            <p>The <hi>minor,</hi> that ſome infants have the whole ſignification of baptiſme, is thus proved; Who have remiſſion of ſins, regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and right to eternall life, they have the whole ſignification of baptiſme. But ſome infants have all theſe. The <hi>major</hi> is clear. I prove the <hi>minor;</hi> None enters into heaven, but they whoſe ſins are remitted, who are regenerate, and to whom life eternall belongs. But ſome infants enter into heaven. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> is not queſtioned, for the words of Chriſt, <hi>of ſuch is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven,</hi> and the confeſſion of the adverſaries puts it out of doubt. The <hi>major</hi> alſo is clear from <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.27. <hi>And there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth.</hi> Nothing comes into heaven but what is perfectly purged, juſtified, ſanctified, glorified; alſo, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Ieſus anſwered, Verily verily, I ſay unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdome of God;</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners: ſo by the obedience of one man many ſhall be made righteous.</hi> As <hi>Adam</hi> makes all that are deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him ſinners, infants as well as others: ſo Chriſt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates his righteouſneſſe to all who are in him, to all whom he receives and acknowledges to be his without any diſtinction of Jew or Gentile, male or female, young or old; who ever have intereſt in Chriſt, are juſtified and ſanctified by him; Now that ſome infants, eſpecially theſe elect ones, who die before the age of diſcretion, have intereſt in Chriſt and his covenant, hath oft been proved.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that infants by this argument may be admitted to the Lords Supper, we deny it, for the Lord himſelf hath put a barre to keepe them off from that Sacrament; alſo they are not capable of the whole ſignification of the Lords Supper, for the thing ſignified therein is not the Lords body and blood ſimply, but his body to be eaten, and his blood to be drunken, by the actuall faith of the communicants; of this active applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on infants are not capable; but in baptiſme no action is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:124957:99"/> required of all who are to be baptized; for as the body may be waſhed without any action of the party who is waſhed: ſo the vertue of Chriſts death and life may be applied in remiſſion and regeneration, by the act of God alone to the ſoul as a meer patient without any action from it.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:124957:99"/> was there any neceſſity of it; for the Diſputants do ſo inſolently out-bragge the City Miniſters, and the matter of their Arguments has ſo often been anſwered in divers Treatiſes, that very juſtly thoſe grave Divines did paſſe them by with contempt; how vain and unworthy all that they bring is, any intelligent perſon may eaſily conſider. Their firſt argument is this, Onely ſuch as <hi>John</hi> and the Apoſtles miniſtred Baptiſm to, ought to be baptized; But <hi>John</hi> and the Apoſtles adminiſtred Baptiſm only to beleevers and not to their infants, <hi>Ergo,</hi> onely beleevers and not their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are to be baptized. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Both <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> are denied; the <hi>major</hi> becauſe it makes examples of Scripture, the full rule of Baptiſm, contrary not only to truth but to the Anabaptiſts own principles, and the Diſputants own arguments following, who are content to make up the Scripturall rule of Baptiſm, not only of examples, but alſo of commands and of other Scripturall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; no man ever in any ordinance of God, did tie alone to Scripturall examples, that is but a partiall rule either of faith or practice. The <hi>minor</hi> likewiſe is denied, for the Apoſtles bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of whole houſe-holds is an example of baptizing of all within the houſe, young and old, male and female, without the exception of infants.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Argument;<note place="margin">The ſecond makes one and the ſame man to differ from himſelfe eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially.</note> Infant Baptiſm differeth eſſentially from the Baptiſm taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles: The eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall difference is put in the ſubject and form of Baptiſm: We bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize infants, Chriſt taught theſe to be baptized who do actually beleeve and repent: We baptize by ſprinkling, Chriſt taught to baptize by dipping. <hi>Anſwer;</hi> The bringing in, in a diſpute before ſimple people, the School term of eſſentiall difference, ſerves more to clogge and darken, then to clear the underſtanding of the hearers; however we deny both the parts of the proof, Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Dipping are two forms of Baptiſm, differing not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, but accidentally, circumſtantially, or modally, ſo to ſpeak, and till of very late the Anabaptiſts themſelves did not ſpeak otherwiſe: but becauſe now our adverſaries are come to make ſprinkling alone a ſufficient ground of nullifying our Baptiſm, we ſhall conſider that whole matter in a Chapter by it ſelf: For the other part of the proof, the eſſential difference of the ſubjects, we deny it upon two grounds; firſt, let the difference betwixt infants and their beleeving Parents be as great as it may, yet it is
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:124957:100"/> nothing to us, who affirm that theſe very places which expreſſe the Baptiſm of beleevers do not inferre the excluſion of infants, but as we proved from the ſame, and other places, do clearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre their Baptiſm. Secondly, theſe new Diſputants do not well to force upon us a new Logick, eſpecially when in their very next argument they baniſh out of this diſpute all the Logick, men have hitherto been acquaint with, whether naturall or artificiall, Do infants and their Parents differ eſſentially? is the difference betwixt any men how repugnant ſoever in qualities and other accidents any more then numericall? who did ever dream that an infant unbaptized did differ from himſelf when thereafter he did beleeve and was baptized, eſſentially? I hope our Diſputants intend not to multiply the ſame individuall perſon to more, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring eſſentially one from the other, or rather one from it ſelf; this were more then ever came in the minde of the Poet, when he doubled the perſons of <hi>Amphitruo</hi> and <hi>Soſia,</hi> or of the Papiſts when they multiply the ſame body in divers places.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The third ties God in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of his will to precepts and examples alone.</note>The third Argument is this, That religious worſhip, for which there is no command nor example in Scripture, is unlawfull: But the Baptiſm of infants is a religious worſhip, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo. Anſ.</hi> This is the ſame in effect with their two former arguments, but that the firſt takes onely one part thereof, examples recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the ſecond clogges it with the needleſſe term of eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall difference. In this third ſhape it is proſecuted with a great deal of high language, as if their adverſaries could not have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered it, while as indeed it is nothing but the old cavill of all the Anabaptiſts, which has been anſwered ſo often as any have ever had to do with any of that generation; and what here is brought to relieve it is ſo abſurd, that few of the Anabaptiſts themſelves will own it. But to the argument it ſelf: Both its propoſitions are falſe, the <hi>major</hi> for this reaſon, The Lords revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will in his word is a ſufficient warrant for our practiſe: now the Lord reveals his will not only by commands and examples, but alſo by promiſes, threatnings, inſtructions, and other ſuch ways of ſpeaking: In this, the former argument came nearer the truth, for it ſpoke of the doctrine of Baptiſm, but did not limit that doctrine to commands and examples alone. Again, the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> is falſe, for all theſe Scripturall commands and examples of Baptiſm which warrantably are applied to the Baptiſm of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:124957:100"/> are ſo many commands and examples written in Scripture for infant Baptiſm, and of thoſe in our arguments for the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive we brought many. Apply this your great and <hi>Achillean</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to another ſubject, and its vanity will quickly appear. That religious worſhip for the which there is no command nor exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Scripture is unlawfull: But womens participation of the Lords Supper, the Baptiſm of Kings, of Merchants, of M. <hi>Cox,</hi> or any perſon in his Congregation is ſuch: For where have they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a command or example for the baptizing of any of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, if they exclude as here they do all kinde of conſequences and deductions from Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The queſtion is not,<note place="margin">It everts the principles of all reaſoning, and turns men into ſtones.</note> If that which by neceſſary conſequence is deduced from Scripture, be Scripture; that is but a needleſſe Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomachy: but if it be a reall truth which we ought to beleeve, and according to which we may lawfully practiſe.</p>
            <p>However ſome old Anabaptiſts over Sea did decline ſo farre as they might, conſequences from Scripture, yet of our late Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts in <hi>England</hi> I have heard of none before thoſe Diſputants that have ever called true Scripturall conſequences into queſtion; and if theſe men ſhould ſtand to this plea, they would quickly involve themſelves into worſe errours then yet they have thought of.</p>
            <p>No Scripture can be made uſe of, or applied for inſtruction, reproof, comfort, or any other ſervice, to any ſingular perſon, but by conſequence, and according to the rule of reaſon, <hi>Dictum de omni &amp; nullo;</hi> deſtroy the principle of reaſoning, you turn anon men into beaſts, into timber and ſtone: The fooliſh Jeſuite <hi>Veron,</hi> who was the chief authour of this extravagancy was quickly cried downe in this madneſſe by his own compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
            <p>The conſequences that here are multiplied about Epiſcopacy, the Service-book, the Ceremonies, &amp;c. are for no purpoſe: for the world knows that no good conſequence from any Scripture could ever be brought for any ſuch corruptions. And for that which here, as alſo in the Preface, is ſo much deſired concerning a publick Diſputation, is but a needleſſe vanity; this was the cry for a long time of the old Anabaptiſts, but when they had gotten their belly full of publick diſputations what the iſſue was, <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> can bear witneſſe. The Diſputants here themſelves relate that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:124957:101"/> it was no ways the fault of the City Miniſters that they got not ſo many and ſo publick diſputations as they wiſhed, but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that their gain by ſuch diſputations, could not have been very great if their Arguments were not much ſtronger then any, which in this Declaration they make publick.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The fourth makes it an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie to make any uſe of any thing in the old Teſtament to clear any thing in the New.</note>Their fourth Argument is this, Infant Baptiſme denies Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, becauſe it takes from him what the holy Ghoſt aſcribes to him, conſidered come in the fleſh, it deſtroyes his Propheticall and Prieſtly office, for it brings light from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the old Teſtament to clear Chriſts Doctrine of Baptiſm, and ſo makes <hi>Moſes</hi> a greater Light then Chriſt: alſo it layes the duty of infant Baptiſm upon the Subjects of Chriſt without his warrant, and ſo puts him from his Kingdome. <hi>Anſwer:</hi> The upſhot and ſtrength of this reaſon is no more then what was brought before, that infants Baptiſm wants the warrant of Chriſt. 2. We ſee by the form of this reaſon to how high a pinne thoſe men do ſtretch our errour (as they count it) of paedobaptiſm: it muſt be no leſſe a crime then the deniall of Chriſts Offices and of his very Incarnation: The people muſt hold us for very groſſe Hereticks, and ſuch from whom a ſeparation is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. 3. The phraſe which here is oft repeated, Chriſt conſidered come in the fleſh, is very obſcure, or elſe a meer non-ſenſe: why conſidered come in the fleſh, rather then come in the fleſh?</p>
            <p>But the chief matter &amp; ground of the argument as here it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned is a new and dangerous crotchet, which the moſt of the Anabaptiſts, as I think, will never own: muſt it be a deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of Chriſts Offices and Incarnation? muſt it be a ſetting up of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets as greater lights above Chriſt and the Apoſtles, when any thing is brought out of the old Teſtament to clear ſome paſſages of the New? When for the clearing of ſundry things both in the Old and New Teſtament we bring paſſages from Pagan, Jewiſh or Chriſtian Writers either old or New, do we hereby ſet up theſe humane Authors as greater lights above Scripture? if the Diſputants would admit of any conſequences, they might ſee what does ſtand at the back of ſuch wild aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but what ever be their minde of conſequences, yet ſome of their followers from this their poſition make two unhappy, though very neceſſary deductions; Firſt, the caſting away of all humane Writs, at leaſt the making of their ſervice towards the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:124957:101"/> clearing of Scripture altogether unlawfull; they make the uſe of all humane Arts and Sciences for this end abominable. Secondly, the laying aſide of the whole old Teſtament, as that which may not be applied for to clear any thing that is in the New: notwithſtanding Chriſt and his Apoſtles are very frequent not only in clearing, but in proving the body of their Doctrine from the Law and the Prophets, yet I hope that none of them for this practice ſhall be counted by the Diſputants deniers of Chriſts Incarnation or any of his Offices.</p>
            <p>Their fifth argument is this,<note place="margin">The fift argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment making the actions done by or to Chriſt the full rule of our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, is a wild phanſie.</note> That which is no part of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe may not be obſerved; But the Baptiſm of infants is no part of righteouſneſſe, becauſe it was neither practiſed upon Chriſts Perſon, nor by him upon any other perſon, he was neither baptized in his infancy, nor did baptize any infants. <hi>Anſwer:</hi> This reaſon is as ſtrange as any of the former, both the <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> are faulty; the <hi>major,</hi> becauſe in common ſpeech and ordinary Scripture language, righteouſneſſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinguiſhed to holineſſe, ſo all acts of holineſſe according to this argument behoved to be unlawfull, being no parts of righteouſneſſe. The <hi>minor</hi> alſo and its proof muſt both be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: Let the word righteouſneſſe be taken in as large a ſenſe as they pleaſe, for all duties either to God or man; for all acts ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of piety, juſtice, or charity, yet to ſay that there is no act of righteouſneſſe which cannot be proved to have been done either by Chriſt or upon Chriſt, is a very wild fancy. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, what will they ſay for the Baptiſm of women, and the Baptiſm of old men? will they deny thoſe to be parts of that righteouſneſſe whereof they ſpeak? or will they affirm that theſe things were practiced either upon the perſon of Chriſt or by the perſon of Chriſt? Chriſt did fulfill all righteouſneſſe when he payed tribute and did all thoſe acts of juſtice which belonged to him, though hee never medled with any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties belonging to others, but were impertinent to him as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing belonging to him, or whereof his perſon was not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The firſt argument concluding the unlawfulneſſe of infant Baptiſm from the want of Scripturall example, was abſurd; but this argument which reſtricts Scripturall example to the perſon of Chriſt onely to things done by him or upon him, is much more abſurd.</p>

This their deadly reaſon is dead and rotten in all its parts: the <hi>major</hi> according to their own principles is clearly falſe, for if none may lawfully be baptized but the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, or his ſeed according to promiſe, and the one be only Jews and the other be only beleevers, what will they ſay to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and thouſands whom themſelves do baptize who are not Jews, and ſo not the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, nor believers and elect perſons, and ſo not the ſeed according to the promiſe, nor the children of the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>minor</hi> likewiſe is falſe in both its parts: Firſt, ſome infants of believing Gentiles may well be counted the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the fleſh, ſuch as are members of the Church viſible, but reprobates. The argument to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary that only Jews are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed according to the fleſh is not good, for theſe very Scriptures <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. &amp; 4. which they cite for its ground do diſtinguiſh the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh and according to the promiſe, the children of <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi> theſe that were born of the free-woman the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above, and the bondwoman <hi>Sinai</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> upon earth: all this is applied to the <hi>Galatians</hi> who were Gentiles, the one part of the diſtinction to thoſe of them who were juſtified by faith, the other to thoſe of them who pleaded for a juſtification by the works of the Law, and thereby lay under the bondage and curſe of the Law: If both parts of the diſtinction may not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Gentile <hi>Galatians,</hi> the ground of the Apoſtle his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and of his whole diſcourſe is overturned.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">This Arg. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways abſurd.</note>The other part of the <hi>minor</hi> is far more abſurd; That only actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all believers are the children of the promiſe; for if ſo, then firſt
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:124957:102"/> at one breath all Chriſtian Infants are blown out of heaven, none of them have any more intereſt in Chriſt, in grace, and in ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation then Turks and Pagans: Thus farre the moſt of the Anabaptiſts wont not to goe, but the Diſputants profeſſe it is their reall meaning; their retortion here upon us is very ſilly, that we do put Chriſtian infants in as evill a condition as they, by granting all infants to be born in originall ſin; for they know that we joyn to this a ſecond aſſertion, That the elect infants of believing Parents, though born in ſin, and the children of wrath by nature as well as others, yet by ſupernaturall grace and mercy are born under the new Covenant, and have their right and intereſt both in the Covenant of grace and the ſeals thereof. Secondly, by this Doctrine the Diſputants cut off all Jewiſh infants from any intereſt in the promiſes of grace: <hi>Iſaac</hi> himſelf, <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> cannot be children of the promiſe in their childhood, but according to the Diſputants they muſt be children according to the fleſh, totally fleſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Covenant of grace, that ſo they behoved to remain till they came to thoſe yeares wherein they did actually believe, and by this actuall faith became children of the promiſe; which promiſe before their actuall faith did no more belong to them then to any other of mankinde. Thirdly, by this argument Circumciſion is made to be a ſeal only of a Covenant of works; So <hi>Iſaac</hi> and the reſt of the Patriarchs by their Circumciſion had no promiſe of grace ſealed unto them; all of them, except <hi>Abraham,</hi> at the time of their Circumciſion, and many years after were under a Covenant of works only, all of them to the years of their diſcretion and actuall faith were incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any intereſt in the Covenant of grace: ſtrange ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities!</p>
            <p>Fourthly, by this argument they muſt profeſſe that none but true believers, juſtified, ſanctified, and elect perſons, are under the Covenant of grace, that ſuch onely have right to participate of the Sacraments, the ſeals of that Covenant, and that ſuch only can be lawfull members of any true Church.</p>
            <p>They reject our diſtinction of an outward and inward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace: We teach that the Covenant of grace in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adminiſtration thereof, both in preaching the promiſes and applying the ſeals of the Sacraments, is to be proponed by Gods
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:124957:103"/> appointment to all the outward viſible members of the Church: But the inward ſaving grace of this Covenant, whether in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word, or adminiſtring the Sacraments, is by the holy Ghoſt conferred onely upon the true living, inviſible members of Chriſts myſticall body. By this common and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary diſtinction, we eſcape eaſily that blot of Arminianiſm which they would lay upon us, for although we put all whom we baptize, and all to whom we preach as to Church members, under the outward adminiſtration of a gracious Covenant, yet do we not grant any true ſaving grace to any but the elect and regenerate who do never totally and finally fall away: But the moſt of our adverſaries are full &amp; groſſe Arminians, yea, their refuſing to diſtinguiſh betwixt the outward and inward Covenant or ſomething equipollent, does draw them to all theſe and greate abſurdities.</p>

            <p>Their eighth argument is another Battology, to wit, that infant Baptiſm is unlawful, becauſe Chriſt did not command his Apoſtles to preach and practice it: Their ninth argument is of the ſame nature; That infant Baptiſm is unlawfull, becauſe it is no part of the revealed will of God; to thoſe tautologies our former an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers need not be repeated.</p>

The firſt makes example alone a full and compleat rule of practice in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:124957:103"/> all ordinances. The ſecond is grounded upon a wilde logick notion of ſuch an eſſentiall difference as makes a man in his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per years differ eſſentially from himſelf in his infancy. The third cuts off all reaſoning from Scripture but <hi>in terminis,</hi> were the conſequence never ſo clear.

The ſeventh, eighth and ninth, are meer repetitions of the third, and import clearly the unlawfulneſſe of the baptiſme, and of the memberſhip of any who is not an actuall and ſincere beleever. If ſuch arguments be very apt to ſeduce thoſe who underſtand the grounds of their religion in any tolerable meaſure, I confeſſe I am much deceived.</p>

I ſhall but name the heads of his reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the doctrine of infant-baptiſme has no teſtimony of Scripture for it:<note place="margin">There is no truth in any of them.</note> the particular Scriptures which are brought to prove this point he endeavours to anſwer; but the chief of theſe anſwers we have met with in our poſitive arguments.</p>
            <p>His ſecond argument is this, in the inſtitution of Baptiſme, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. Chriſt has not appointed infants to be baptized, becauſe they are not Diſciples. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Their Baptiſme is unlawfull. To this we did ſpeak at length.</p>
            <p>The third is, Infant-baptiſme is not according to the practiſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:124957:104"/> of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and the Apoſtles who baptized onely peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent beleevers: to this alſo we have often ſpoken.</p>
            <p>The fourth and the fifth is, That infant-baptiſme in the ages next to the Apoſtles was not in uſe: and when it came in uſe, that it was grounded upon divers errors and unwriten traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If the Anabaptiſts did any whit regard antiquity, it were eaſie by formall teſtimonies to refell theſe two aſſertions, and this the replyers to M. <hi>Tombs</hi> has done abundantly. But it is well known, that the Anabaptiſts generally have no regard to humane writers; ſo it were but loſſe of time to bring paſſages of the Fathers for their conviction.</p>
            <p>His ſixt, ſeventh, and eighth arguments are theſe, Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme hath occaſioned many humane inventions, many errours, many abuſes in Diſcipline and worſhip. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Some of theſe things which he cals humane inventions, errors and abuſes, are denyed to be ſuch; and thoſe which be ſuch, indeed are neither cauſed nor occaſioned by Paedobaptiſme.

            <p>HOw abundant and copious in the faculty of lying and inventing of errours,<note place="margin">The lying ſpirit of Anabaptiſm.</note> the ſpirit of Anabaptiſme was of old; how much ſuperiour in an extreamly malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fruitfulnes he hath been to any evil ſpirit that ever appeared in the Chriſtian Church before him; we have I hope, demonſtrate in our firſt two Chapters. That the younger Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts who thus trouble the Church of England, are nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to their Fathers in the art of erring, being ſure where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they are aſhamed of any one of their predeceſſors tenets to give us two much worſe in the place thereof, we have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make appear in our third and fourth Chapters.</p>
            <p>Among the new inventions of the late Anabaptiſts, there is none which with greater animoſity they ſet on foot, then the neceſſity of dipping over head and ears, then the nullity of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and ſprinkling in the adminiſtration of baptiſme.<note place="margin">The preſſing of dipping and exploding of ſprinkling is but an yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day conceit of the Engliſh A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts.</note> Among the old Anabaptiſts, or theſe over ſea to this day ſo far as I can learn, by their writs or any relation that yet has come to my ears, the queſtion of dipping and ſprinkling came never upon the Table. As I take it they dip none, but all whom they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, they ſprinkle in the ſame manner as is our cuſtome. The queſtion about the neceſſity of dipping ſeems to be taken up onely the other year by the Anabaptiſts in England, as a point which alone, as they conceive, is able to carry their deſire of exterminating infant-baptiſme: for they know that parents upon no conſideration will be content to hazard the life of their tender infants, by plunging them over head and ears in a cold river. Let us therefore conſider if this ſparkle of new light have any derivation from the lamp of the Sanctuary, or the Sun of righteouſneſſe, if it be according to Scripturall truth, or any good reaſon.</p>
            <p>For the ſtating of the queſtion,<note place="margin">The ſtate of the queſtion.</note> the tearms of dipping and ſprinkling muſt be a little cleared; by ſprinkling we underſtand according as our adverſaries not unfitly expreſſe it, an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:124957:105"/> of water to the perſon, whether in greater or ſmaller meaſure, whether by drops ſeverally ſcattered, or poured on all together: ſo that there be no ſenſible diſgregation of the water applyed. The diſtinction of affuſion from ſprinkling in this matter, ſeems to be but a needleſſe curioſity; By dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping they underſtand an application of the whole perſon to the water, a putting of the whole perſon in the water, not a pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the water upon the perſon; an intinction not of one member, but of the whole body, a ducking, an immerſion of the whole body under the water. Conſider farther, that we doe not oppoſe the lawfulneſſe of dipping in ſome caſes, but the neceſſity of it in all caſes: Neither doe they impugne the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency of ſprinkling in ſome caſes, but the lawfulneſſe of it in any caſe. So both their doctrine and practiſe makes the ſtate of the queſtion to be this; Whether in Baptiſme it be neceſſary to put the whole baptized perſon over the head and ears in the water, or if it be lawfull and ſufficient, at leaſt in ſome caſes, to poure or ſprinkle the water upon the head of the perſon baptized? For the lawfulneſſe of ſprinkling and againſt the neceſſity of dipping,<note place="margin">Sprinkling is ſufficient, and dipping is not neceſſary in Baptiſme.</note> I reaſon thus.</p>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:124957:105"/> is thrice expreſſed under the name of baptiſme, can be no other thing but a waſhing by ſprinkling, and no ways by a totall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion or dipping; for is it imaginable that the Phariſees, oft times every day, even ſo oft as they went to meat, yea, ſo oft as they came home from the ſtreets did caſt off their cloaths and dip themſelves over head and ears in water? ſenſe and reaſon will be againſt ſo troubleſome a ſuperſtition; the text it ſelf expones the Phariſees daily and almoſt hourely baptiſme of the waſhing of their hands; now the ordinary way of waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hands among the Jews was, by pouring water upon the hands from a laver, not by putting the hands in a baſon, as we read 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.11. <hi>Here is</hi> Eliſha <hi>the ſon of</hi> Shaphat, <hi>which poured water on the hands of</hi> Elijah. Alſo the baptiſme of brazen veſſels, of tables or beds, (for then in their <hi>triclinia</hi> tables and beds were all one thing, or at leaſt were joyned together) could be no other but pouring ſome little water upon them: for ſuppoſe, that contrary to the common cuſtome of all Nations in all times, all their great and heavy veſſels of braſſe and iron in every one of their waſhings had been put into the water, and no water poured upon them, yet how is it poſſible that all their tables and their beds, many times every day, ſhould be brought to deep rivers, &amp; there put wholly under the water? Such a practiſe, if poſſible, had made the toyle of all the Jewiſh ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants unſupportable, and yet according to the Anabaptiſts Lexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cography, all this labour was ſimply neceſſary.</p>

In the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Jews baptiſmes by blood were onely by ſprinkling; no perſons among them were drowned in blood, onely in their purifications, blood was poured or ſprinkled upon them: in reference to this manner of application, the Antitype Chriſts blood, whereby the Church is truly waſhed from ſin, is called the <hi>blood of ſprinkling, Heb.</hi> 12.24. As for the old baptiſms with water divers of them were by ſprinkling alone; <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.7. <hi>And thus ſhalt thou doe unto them to cleanſe them, ſprinkle
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:124957:106"/> water of purifying upon them;</hi> the moſt of theſe baptiſmes were by pouring out of water upon the perſon, few, if any, by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping over head and ears. The ordinary and daily waſhing of the Prieſts at the great laver and brazen ſea, was not by plunging in the water, but by pouring out the water on the perſon to be waſhed. The ſea made by <hi>Solomon</hi> ſtood high on the back of the brazen buls, and had no ſteps without for any to aſcend, and within for any to deſcend into it: and the laver in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle made by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was not of the capacity for one man to bath, much leſſe for all the Prieſts who had to doe about the Altar at one time. Farther, the preſcribed manner of waſhing, was onely of the hands and of the feet, though it be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that the Prieſts might have ſtretched themſelves to dip their hands in the laver ſtanding upon his high baſe; yet how ſhall we conceive them able to have put their feet into that laver? Doubtleſſe, many of the legall baptiſmes and waſhings were onely by ſprinkling and pouring out, and not by dipping or drowning into the blood or water.</p>

We read, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.3. that the fiery cloven tongues did onely come down and ſit upon them. By all this we ſee how frequent the holy Ghoſt in the very New Teſtament is in aſcribing the name and ſtyle of baptiſme to that which cannot be any dipping, and is nothing elſe but a ſprinkling, a pouring out, an application of water, blood, or fire, to the ſubject; and not of the ſubject to thoſe things, much contrary to the credulity and bold aſſertion of the late Anabaptiſts.</p>

            <p>The chief end of applying water to any body, whether by dipping of it in the water, or ſprinkling the water upon it, is to purge it from ſoile;<note place="margin">Sprinkling ſerves as much for purging as dipping can do.</note> that the uſe of water in baptiſme is to remove and waſh away, albeit not the defilement of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet the guilt of ſin from the ſoul; we read in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3 21.</note>

            <p>A third Argument, If dipping be neceſſary, and ſprinkling unſufficient, then in all Scripturall approved baptiſmes, dipping was uſed, and not ſprinkling; But no ſuch thing does appear in Scripture. Whether in any Sacramentall baptiſme mentioned in Scripture, dipping over head and ears was ever practiſed, we ſhall conſider in our anſwer to the objections; but that in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Sacramentall baptiſmes approved in Scripture, no dipping at all was uſed,<note place="margin">In many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall baptiſms there was no dipping.</note> we prove by three examples.</p>
            <p>At the firſt and greateſt Baptiſme we read of, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41.<note place="margin">Acts 2.41.</note> 
               <hi>Then they that gladly received his word were baptized, and the ſame day there were added unto them about three thouſand ſoules,</hi> there could be no dipping, for that baptizing ſo far as the text inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates was in the ſtreets, in the ſame place wherein the people did hear <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon. Now how was it poſſible to dip in the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:124957:108"/> ſtreets of Jeruſalem three thouſand perſons? There was no river in that place, yea, in all Jeruſalem we remember not of any river, unleſſe it were the brook Kedron, which run through the Suburbs in the valley under the Town, which was ſo ſmall a ſtrand, that at no time, eſpecially not at the Pentecoſt in the midſt of Summer, it was any ways meet for the immerſion of aged people. I grant they had in Jeruſalem divers fountains, and pools, and in ſome families were veſſels for bathing; but that either the Apoſtles went to theſe fountains and pools, or that any bathing veſſels were brought out to them, there is not the leaſt appearance in any Scripture. Alſo which way ſoever you can imagine the matter to have been carried, the dipping over head and ears of three thouſand perſons could not in one half day bee performed by the hands of twelve weak men, though you ſhould give to them the aſſiſtance of the whole ſeventy Diſciples; and if any ſuch action had been performed, it behoved to have made ſuch a din and noiſe, as would certainly have commoved the whole City; and being ſo notable and new a circumſtance, could hardly have been paſt in ſilence by the Penmen of that holy Hiſtory. Thoſe and many more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences and impoſſibilities cannot be ſatisfied upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of dipping, but admitting of ſprinkling the caſe is made not onely poſſible, but very eaſie, for the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in a few houres, to baptize not onely three, but five thouſand, and if need had been, many more.</p>
            <p>The other example is that of the baptiſme of <hi>Paul</hi> by <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias, Acts</hi> 9.18, 19.<note place="margin">Acts 9.18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been ſcales, and he received ſight forthwith, and aroſe and was baptized, and when he had received meat he was ſtrengthned. Paul</hi> is here baptized in his lodging houſe, being yet ſick and weak, and having faſted three whole days: Suppoſe, whereof there is no probability, that in his lodging houſe there had been accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations for his plunging and immerſion, yet being in ſo weak a condition, as the miraculous viſion of Chriſt, and the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary long faſting put him into, he was very unfit to be ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and plunged over head and all, in cold water. To aſſert this without any appearance of ground from Scripture, is but raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <pb n="171" facs="tcp:124957:108"/>
            <p>The third example we have in <hi>Acts</hi> 16.33.<note place="margin">Acts 16.33.</note> 
               <hi>And he took them the ſame houre of the night and waſhed their ſtripes, and was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, he and all his ſtraightway.</hi> Which way could the Gaoler and all his houſhold in the midſt of the night be brought to any deep river and plunged over head and ears by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſhed of their ſores, can hardly be imagined.</p>
            <p>A fourth reaſon; Nothing is neceſſary in Baptiſme which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally is hurtfull to the life or chaſtity of any;<note place="margin">Arg. 4. Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping is hurtfull to the life of man.</note> for the unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable God is never contrary to himſelf, all his laws and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances have an harmonious conſonancy one with another; the Lord having diſcharged in the ſixth and ſeventh Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the practiſe of all things hurtfull to the life and chaſtity of men, he will not in any of his Sacraments appoint that to be practiſed, which is of ſuch a nature. But ſo it is, that dipping over head and ears in baptiſme, is naturally hurtfull both to the life and chaſtity; to the life, though we ſpeak nothing of young infants, many of riper years in divers places of the earth, yea, in the hotteſt climates at ſome times of the year, cannot be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged over the head in cold water, without evident hazard, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of life, and often of health, and this much experience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our ſelves does teach, in that ſhort time wherein this noyſome ceremony has been brought in faſhion.</p>
            <p>As for chaſtity,<note place="margin">Alſo to his chaſtity.</note> muſt it not be a great ſcandall, in the face of all the Congregation, where alone, Sacraments can be duly celebrated, for men and women to ſtand up naked, as they were born; and naked men to goe into the water with naked wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, holding them in their arms till they have plunged them in the water? it is true, one of the great Anabaptiſtick Maſters <hi>David George</hi> made it a part of his art, to teach all his Diſciples to look one upon anothers nakedneſſe, and to doe much more then behold, without any carnall motion; but ſuch villanous hypocriſie cannot be but deteſtable to all honeſt minds. Some hundred years agoe, when the chaſtity and ſimplicity of the world was greater, then in theſe our wretched days, the dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of naked perſons was ſo full of ſcandall, that it occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a number of humane inventions about Baptiſme, as the Deaconeſſes, the white garments, &amp;c. and thereafter cauſed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> change of that ceremony, where it had gotten place, into the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:124957:109"/> much more convenient rite of ſprinkling.</p>
            <p>One other reaſon; That is not neceſſarily required in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme which lays both upon the baptized, and the baptizer bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens which they are not able to bear; But dipping does ſo. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> is grounded upon the nature of Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, eſpecially of the New Teſtament; they are an eaſie yoak and portable. The <hi>minor</hi> is thus clear, by the neceſſity of this rite the baptizer is obliged to dip the whole baptized perſons under the water, and to lift them up again above the water, but this for the moſt part of baptizers is altogether unpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:<note place="margin">A fifth argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, dipping makes baptiſme inſupportable. No Preacher will be able to baptize.</note> How many Preachers are of that bodily ſtrength as to lift up in their arms a man to dip him in the water, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to lift him clear out of the water? for according to our adverſaries, baptiſme is the dipping of the whole man into the water, and the lifting of the whole man again out of the water; the putting of his head and breaſt into the water is but a dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of a part of the body, the lifting of the head and upper parts of the body, and not of the lower and whole parts, is not a full and compleat baptiſme: now for this dipping of the whole man under the water, and lifting of the whole man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the water, the ſtrength of more men then one is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; And yet Scripture requires for the adminiſtration of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, no more agents then one.</p>
            <p>Again, this dipping puts upon the baptized, burthens which neither nature, nor civility, nor religion permits them to bear:<note place="margin">Dipping whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed or naked perſons is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable</note> We read not in Scripture, that perſons in baptiſme did ſtrip themſelves of their garments; and if this had been the cuſtome, it's very like that Scripture had not always paſt it over: For ordinarily in Hiſtoricall narrations, Scripture marks the caſting off of the cloaths: ſo in the prophecying of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.24. <hi>And he ſtripped off his cloaths alſo and propheſied before</hi> Samuel <hi>in like manner, and lay down naked all that day, and all that night.</hi> So in the young man who followed Chriſt at his taking, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.52. <hi>And he left the linnen cloth and fled from them naked.</hi> So in the crucifying of Chriſt, <hi>Mark.</hi> 15.24. <hi>And when they had cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him they parted his garments;</hi> ſo in many other Hiſtories: wherefore if always in baptiſme the perſons had been ſtripped, we know no reaſon why ſometimes Scripture would not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:124957:109"/> this conſiderable circumſtance. Suppoſing therefore the dipping of the baptized perſons with their garments upon them, we ſay that this did bring a burthen upon them which to nature had been inſupportable: for immediately after Baptiſm we read of their going to the Table, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.33, 34. alſo <hi>Acts</hi> 9.18, 19. without any change of apparell, ſo far as Scripture expreſſes it, or by any circumſtance of any text can be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now how intolerable it is to nature for any perſon to be dipped in their garments over head and ears, and without any ſhifting of their wet cloathes to goe to the Table, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther employment, ſenſe can inform a very ſimple man.</p>
            <p>If you ſuppoſe their nakedneſſe in baptiſme as the moſt of our dippers doe, though without any Scripturall warrant, then how extreamly contrary to all civility will every modeſt perſon finde it to diſcover himſelfe before a whole Congregation of people? Though it be a part of the Georgian and Familiſtick Anabaptiſme, to lay down all naturall ſhame, yet God has imprinted ſo much ſhamefaſtneſſe in the hearts of all ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> that no honeſt and ingenuous perſon can endure to ſtand naked before any company: and if this ſhould be put upon them by any neceſſity, they could not but take it for a great and diſgracefull affliction.</p>
            <p>As dipping puts more upon the baptized then nature and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility can bear, ſo likewiſe then can conſiſt with religion; Divinity admits not of Se-baptiſme,<note place="margin">Dipping brings in Se-baptiſm.</note> and permits not the baptized to be agents, but in this act will have them to be patients, and baptized by others; now in dipping the moſt part of the body is put under the water by the parties baptized themſelves: for, as they ſay the cuſtome is, they goe into the water and ſtand there above the middle; why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they not to be reputed as well baptizers, who put the moſt parts of the body in the water as they who put the leſſe?</p>
            <p>Againſt all this the grand diſputants object, Firſt, that the word <hi>Baptizein</hi> does ſignifie onely to dip or waſh, and never to ſprinkle:<note place="margin">The firſt obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, That the originall word Baptzein does ſignifie always dipping and never ſprinkling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved</note> to prove this they bring the authority of the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagints, of <hi>Nonnus,</hi> of <hi>Voſſius.

            <p>The <hi>minor</hi> alſo, That baptiſme does always ſignifie dipping, and never ſprinkling, we deny; in our firſt argument for the affirmative, we gave eight inſtances to the contrary out of the New Teſtament, to which we may adde, beſide other places, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.38.<note place="margin">Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The authorities mentioned are nothing to the purpoſe; that of the Septuagints, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.14. <hi>Then went he down and dipped himſelf ſeven times in Jordan, according to the ſaying of the man of God;</hi> it onely proves a waſhing of <hi>Naamans</hi> body in Jordan, according to the Prophets direction; every true waſhing is not by a totall immerſion, as daily experience and many Scriptures prove; the woman waſhed Chriſts feet with her tears, and <hi>David</hi> waſhed his bed with his tears, onely by ſprinkling. But ſuppoſe the Septuagints in this place had taken the word for a dipping over head and ears, will it follow that the word is no otherwiſe taken by any Authour any where elſe? Goe to the ſame Septuagints, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.33.<note place="margin">Dan. 4.33.</note>

We grant that <hi>Nonnus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds <hi>baptizo</hi> by <hi>cathairo,</hi> but this makes nothing at all for dipping, for many more purifications were by ſprinkling and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion then by immerſion and dipping.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Voſſius,</hi> ſuppoſe his criticiſme were well founded, that <hi>baptizein</hi> did ſignifie principally to dip, which may very well be queſtioned; (for why may we not make the firſt ſignification of the word to be waſhing, and the ſecond dipping, the firſt being the end, and the other but the mean, as well as to make dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the firſt ſignification, and waſhing the ſecond, becauſe the one is the cauſe, and the other the effect?) yet all this is for no purpoſe, for though the word did ſignifie firſt to dip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet if in the ſecond, third, fourth, fifth, or any place it ſignified to ſprinkle, it is enough for all that we affirm: now that the word <hi>baptizo,</hi> has truly this ſignification of ſprinkling, <hi>Voſſius</hi> in this very place alledged to the contrary does prove it from many paſſages both of Scripture and Antiquity.</p>
            <p>Their ſecond objection they take from theſe Scriptures, where the baptized ſeem to have been dipped,<note place="margin">The ſecond objection, No evidence in Scripture that any were ever dipped over head and ears in Baptiſme.</note> 
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.13.16. <hi>Then commeth Jeſus from Galilee to Jordan unto</hi> Iohn <hi>to be baptized of him, and Jeſus when he was baptized went up ſtraightway out of the water.</hi> Iohn 3.23. <hi>And</hi> Iohn <hi>alſo was baptizing in Enon, becauſe there was much water there.</hi> Act. 8.38, 39. <hi>And he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Chariot to ſtand ſtill, and they went down both into the water, both</hi> Philip <hi>and the Eunuch, and he baptized him, and when they were come up out of the water, &amp;c. Anſ.</hi> Firſt, ſuppoſe that in all theſe places dipping had been uſed, it follows not that it was ſo univerſally; we have proved that divers Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall baptiſmes were by ſprinkling, and not by dipping. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, although dipping had been univerſall in the Primitive times, yet th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s practiſe would not inferre any neceſſity of its conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, unleſſe two things were made good; firſt, that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and example alone is a ſufficient ground for the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sacramentall rite; again, that every circumſtance of a Sacrament generally practiſed in Scripturall times, muſt be of an unchangeable and unvariable nature, and ſo neceſſary, that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:124957:111"/> without ſin it may not in any caſe be altered. Thirdly, none of the places alledged, doe look towards the dipping of a naked perſon over head and ears, which is the main queſtion. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is no word expreſly in any of the places of dipping, and if they will admit us to diſpute by conſequences, ſee if from any of thoſe places there be a neceſſary inference of any dipping; the multitude of waters in the third of <hi>John,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 3.23.</note> infers not the plunging of all who were baptized in them, but onely the conveniency of baptizing a multitude, rather in a place of many waters then in a deſert void of water, ſuch as many places in Canaan were. In the days of the Patriarchs the finding of a fountain in theſe bounds was a rare and ſingular benefit: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we deny that the conveniency of much water for the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of a multitude of people, does import a neceſſity of dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping any who are baptized therein.</p>
            <p>The other place of <hi>Act.</hi> 8.38, 39. imports <hi>Philip</hi> and the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs going down from the coach towards the water, and their aſcending again into the coach from the lower place where the water was; but doth either this deſcending, or aſcending, infer <hi>Philips</hi> ſtripping of the Eunuch, and dipping him over head and ears in that water?</p>
            <p>The third place is not ſo important, for it ſpeaks nothing of Chriſts going down into the water, and what it ſays of his comming up may well be expounded of the low ſituation of the river beneath the field, where <hi>John</hi> did preach: readily they have ſtood on the brink, or within the river when they were ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and had the water of the river poured upon them, but that in the midſt of that multitude Chriſt did diſcover himſelf, and that <hi>John</hi> ſo oft as he baptized any did cauſe to ſtrip both himſelf and them, and went ſo naked with them into the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taking them in his arms, and plunging them therein, is a matter of ſo great unlikelihood, that without Scripture or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon then yet appears it may not be admitted.</p>
            <p>The third objection, Immerſion is neceſſarily to be practiſed, becauſe it ſignifies our buriall with Chriſt,<note place="margin">The third ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, That Baptiſme is a ſign of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of Chriſt, has no refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at all to Immerſion.</note> according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4. <hi>Know ye not that ſo many of us as were baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized into his death? therefore wee are buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him by Baptiſme unto death;</hi> alſo <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Buried with
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:124957:111"/> him in Baptiſme, wherein alſo you are riſen with him. Anſ.</hi> Firſt, it is a preſumption in any man to put a divine inſtitution upon any rite, which in its own nature is onely indifferent; But it is a preſumption in the higheſt degree to affixe a ſignification to any ſuch rite; we grant Baptiſme for its ſignification has the death of Chriſt and all the fruits thereof, alſo that it ſeals to us our fellowſhip not onely in Chriſts death, but in his buriall, his reſurrection, his aſcenſion, his ſitting at the right hand of God; but what divers Scriptures, and particularly the places in hand do aſcribe to Baptiſme, we have no warrant to apply it unto im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if men would goe to make analogicall ſignifications according to their own pleaſure, we might ſay that ſprinkling did put water upon the head, and ſo the whole perſon under the water, and by this were a ſign of buriall as well as immerſion. It makes nothing againſt this, that by ſprinkling, a little quantity of water is applyed onely to the head, and much water by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping is applyed to the whole body, for in Sacraments the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the element, the ſhortneſſe of the outward action is not attended: The taſting of a little bread and a little wine does ſignifie to us our full communion with the whole body and the whole blood of Chriſt, as well as the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt banquet of wine and all delicates could do. The cutting off a very little from one part of the body only did ſignifie the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and cutting off of the whole body of corruption, as wel as if much skin &amp; much fleſh had been cutted off from every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: even ſo the ſprinkling of a little water may ſignifie and ſeal up unto us our participation in Chriſts life, death, buriall, reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and every thing elſe of his wherein we have intereſt, as well as a totall immerſion in the whole Ocean for ſo long a time as <hi>Jonah</hi> lay under the billows of the great deep.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this argument draws us to two great inconveniences:<note place="margin">The danger of dipping.</note> Firſt, a neceſſity, as we would not aboliſh a Sacramentall and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant rite, to keep every baptized perſon ſo long a time whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the water, as may ſenſibly expreſſe Chriſts buriall under the ground; now to be put for ſo long a time wholly under the water by the hand of a weak Miniſter, though never ſo carefull to preſerve, cannot but bring an evident hazard of life or health to many.</p>
            <pb n="178" facs="tcp:124957:112"/>
            <p>Secondly, conſider if it bring not in the inſtitution of a new Sacrament, whereof none that yet I have heard of have ſpoken, the Sacrament of emerſion,<note place="margin">The new Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> at leaſt the addition of this as a new large half unto the old Sacrament of Baptiſme or Immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; this their new rite of emerſion does ſignifie and ſeal up to us as they ſay our reſurrection with Chriſt: this can be no part of baptiſme or immerſion, nor rationally be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under it, though always it were conjoyned and did follow at its back; for emerſion and immerſion are contraries, and one contrary is not a part, nor cannot goe under the name of the other, except you will make bitter ſweet, and darkneſſe light.</p>
            <p>Unto thoſe Arguments of the Diſputants the Treatiſer adds nothing conſiderable in all his long Diſcourſe, except ſome teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, partly from Proteſtant, but moſt from Popiſh writers: aſſerting the ancient cuſtome of dipping in baptiſme.<note place="margin">A generall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the teſtimonies for dipping.</note> To which I anſwer, firſt, what ever authority teſtimonies may have with us, yet with him that brings them, and with his whole party, they are of no value at all: Will they miſlike, or ſo much as ſuſpect any of their abſurdeſt novelties, when it is demonſtrate to them that the whole current of all Chriſtian writers anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern is againſt them? is it not then their cuſtome with a great deal of ſcorn to declaim againſt the vanity and frivolouſneſſe of an argument from humane aſſertions? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Treatiſer himſelfe cannot but know that every one of the Authours he brings, does poſitively impugne his aſſertion, the neceſſity of dipping and unlawfulneſſe of ſprinkling in Baptiſme. Thirdly, his witneſſes, though they aſſert indefinitely the antiquity of dipping, yet none of them does deny the like ancient uſe of ſprinkling; both thoſe may well ſtand together, and ſo it is the judgement of many, that ſometimes dipping, and ſometimes ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as the occaſion required were practiſed in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times. Fourthly, of thoſe that ſpeak of ancient dipping, how many doe underſtand it of the totall immerſion of a naked body over head and ears? and yet this alone is our queſtion. Fifthly, though even for this teſtimonies were brought, yet they come not home unleſſe ſuch a dipping be
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:124957:112"/> atteſted to be a rite unchangeable, and ſo neceſſary, that the omiſſion of it at any occaſion, were a ſin, and breach of the Lords inſtitution. When any writer, either ancient or modern, except ſome few of the lateſt Anabaptiſts, is brought to bear witneſſe to any ſuch aſſertion, I ſhall acknowledge my information of that whereof hitherto I have been alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ignorant.</p>
